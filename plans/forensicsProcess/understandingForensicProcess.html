<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The aim of all digital investigations, whether they conclude in court or not, the results of the process must be admissible in a court of law. The process followed by investigators is crucial in ensuring admissibility of evidence. Consequently, in this activity learners are asked to consider flawed investigations.</p>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="readingList.html">Flawed Digital Investigations Reading List</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="form-start-up">Form start-up</h3>
<p>Individuals are required to form a start-up organisation of no more than <strong>FIVE</strong> members and no less than <strong>FOUR</strong> members.</p>
<h3 id="task-1-research-characteristics-of-the-forensics-process">Task 1: Research characteristics of the Forensics Process</h3>
<p>Each member of the start-up will act as resident expert for an aspect of the forensics process. Each team member should select and research one of the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Provenance and Integrity.</strong> Accepted standards and procedures must be followed by investigators when acquiring evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scientific Methodology.</strong> The outcomes of an investigation should be reproducibility by a third-party to ensure validity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tool Validation.</strong> The tools used within a digital investigation need to be validated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Forensic Procedure.</strong> The members of the court must have confidence in the outcomes of forensics process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Triage.</strong> The volume of data can result in investigations being delayed and salient points being missed. Consequently, effective triaging must be performed to reduce the data being considered.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="task-2-expert-discussion-on-characteristics-of-the-forensics-process">Task 2: Expert discussion on characteristics of the Forensics Process</h3>
<p>Each expert member should meet with the expert member from other start-ups and discuss the specific aspect they have researched. Each expert member should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Share what they have discovered from their research.</strong> Expert members should share the salient and interesting aspects of what they have learned from their research on legal approaches for the country or region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Articulate expert presentation for start-up.</strong> Expert members should share the presentation they are going to present to their start-up to get feedback and support from other expert members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support and provide feedback to other experts.</strong> Expert members should provide feedback and support to other experts in shaping their presentation to their start-up firms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Experts should reflect on the feedback they received and what they have observed in their expert discussion session when refining their expert presentation. Experts should recall that their start-up firms are relying on their presentation of research into characteristics of the Forensics process.</p>
<h3 id="task-3-experts-presentation-to-start-ups">Task 3: Experts presentation to start-ups.</h3>
<p>Experts should return to their start-up firm and give their presentation. The leader of the firm should then determine the appropriate running order and ask each expert within the start-up firm to present their research. The leader of the start-up firm should encourage members to ask questions as well as ensure that presentations and questions for a particular aspect do not exceed <strong>10</strong> minutes.</p>
