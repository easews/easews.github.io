<p>Upon receiving feedback, develop a plan for action. The rationale is to engage with the feedback and consider what actions, if any, can be taken to improve for the next attempt at the assessment.</p>
<p>Reflect on performance on the activity and the feedback received. Organise the feedback along the following dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Start.</strong> What can you start doing for next time? For example, if the feedback received that points are not cemented in evidence. Then a practical next action would be to consider the points made and they can be cemented in evidence with appropriate sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stop.</strong> What should you stop doing the next time round? For example, if the feedback received states that the sources of evidence is low-quality. Then a practical next action would be to define what high-quality evidence looks like in the present domain and then communicate that to the audience when presenting supporting evidence. Consequently, the audience has deeper insight into how you have curated and selected evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continue.</strong>  What should you continue doing the next time you perform the activity? For example, if the feedback received for a presentation is that you are persuasive in presenting argument. Then a practical next action would be to consider and reflection what makes your presentation persuasive and how that can be applied elsewhere in your debate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The important point is to engage and consider each element received as it can be valuable in refining knowledge and skills.</p>
