<p>Holly Adams from Missouri stated that Raymon Miller was the father of her child.
Authorities stated that Raymon Miller must pay child support for the child.
Raymon Miller stated he refused to pay child support as he was not the father.
Raymon Miller stated his identical twin brother, Richard, was the father of the child.</p>
<p>Raymon and Richard both participated in DNA testing to confirm the father of the child.
The test was inclusive as either brother had equal probability of being the father of the child.
Authorities continued to hold Raymon Miller as the father of the child.
Raymon Miller disputes that he is the father of the child.</p>
