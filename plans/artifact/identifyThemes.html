<p>Teams should spend <strong>10</strong> minutes discussing and recalling the presentations from others and begin to identify at least <strong>TWO</strong> applications of hash functions that were common across many or all of the presentations. Learners should also consider in what ways the presentations diverge as well as novel or distinct insights that where presented by others.</p>
<p>After a brief break, teams will be advised to spend <strong>10</strong> minutes discussing and considering at least <strong>THREE</strong> desirable qualities (e.g. speed) that such hash functions should exhibit that would underpin the applications identified.</p>
<p>Teams will then be required to spend <strong>FIVE</strong> minutes on producing a single presentation slide that briefly documents the <strong>TWO</strong> applications and <strong>THREE</strong> desirable qualities.</p>
