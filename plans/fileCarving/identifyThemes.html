        <h2 id="task-identify-emerging-themes">Task: Identify Emerging themes</h2>
<p>Teams should spend <strong>10</strong> minutes discussing and recalling the presentations from other teams and begin to identify at least <strong>THREE</strong> emerging themes that were common across many or all of the presentations. Teams should also consider in whats way they diverge and novel or distinct insight other firms formed.</p>
<p>Teams should produce a <strong>ONE</strong> slide presentation that prioritises and describes <strong>THREE</strong> emerging themes as well as <strong>ONE</strong> novel divergence or insight that captured they observed from other teams.</p>
<p>Teams should use the following concepts as starting points in the consideration of different emerging themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fragmentation rates for file types.</strong> How did firms recognise this when they generated mock file system containers? How do the carving algorithms devised by teams accommodate different fragmentation rates?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adjacent file blocks.</strong> How do the carving algorithms devised by teams decide how to determine the optimal sequence of file blocks?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scale.</strong> How do the carving algorithms devised by teams reflect the challenge that scale presents?</p>
</li>
</ul>
