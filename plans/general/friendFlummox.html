<p>Learners are going to devise an exam question that challenges peers but also probes understanding of challenges around the admissibility of evidence.</p>
<h2 id="task-1-devise-the-exam-question">Task 1: Devise the exam question</h2>
<p>Learners should start by reflecting on the interesting challenges surrounding the admissibility of evidence. Then consider how you can creatively assess if a peer is aware of such challenges.</p>
<p>Learners then should consider how they would ask the question, it could be text or require demonstration of a skill. Learners are not constrained to text alone.</p>
<h2 id="task-2-self-organise-into-groups-of-pairs">Task 2: Self-organise into Groups of Pairs</h2>
<p>Learners are to self-organise into pairs or groups and exchange their exam questions or communicate how they are going to examine peers.</p>
<p>Partner-up and start to work your way through the different exam questions that have been formulated in the group. Have fun and help each other out with answering the questions.</p>
<p>After completing each question, reflect and document what you felt was strong about the exam question as well as how it could be improved.</p>
<h2 id="task-3-nominate-exam-question">Task 3: Nominate exam question</h2>
<p>Reflecting on the exam question posed by peer, if you feel the question devised by a peer is creative and/or challenging then nominate it. The lecturer or instructor will then get the class to vote on the strongest submission.</p>
<p>The lecturer or instructor will ask you to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Explain the exam question.</strong> Outline the premise of the exam question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communicate why it is creative.</strong> Explain to the class why the question itself is creative and novel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explain what it probes.</strong> Rationale as to what the exam question probes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explain why that is important for the course.</strong> Rationale as to why the question is important for the course itself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
