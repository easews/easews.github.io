<p>The aim of the activity pack is for individuals to develop an awareness of the fundamental legal approaches to forced and compelled decryption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The legal approach relies on compelling the person with knowledge of the relevant encryption keys to surrender them. This is relatively new legal territory and its treatment varies across jurisdictions. In the UK, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 specifies the circumstances under which individuals are legally required to disclose the keys. Disclosure may run counter the legal right against self-incrimination and in some jurisdictions, such as in the United States, it is not yet definitively resolved. <a href="https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/Forensics_v1.0.1.pdf">CyBOK Forensics Knowledge Area P(17)</a></p>

</ol>
<h2 id="activity">Activity</h2>
<p>Learners are required to form start-up firms that are required to identify, research and present legal approaches for undermining encryption for a specific country or region. Start-up firms are to research, produce and present a FIVE minute presentation. The class will then consider the themes and lessons learned from the various presentations. The resulting presentations as well as subsequent lessons learned will be made available to the class after the session.</p>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li>Country and Region List</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="form-start-up">Form start-up</h3>
<p>Individuals are required to form a start-up organisation of no more than <strong>FIVE</strong> members and no less than <strong>FOUR</strong> members. Firms should select a leader and select a country from the <em>Country and Region List</em> to research legal approaches used by the country or region for key disclosure and convey it to the wider class.</p>
<p>A legal approach in this context can be broadly considered any approach that forces or compels the individual with encryption keys to disclose them to relevant authorities.</p>
<h3 id="task-1-research-aspect-of-legal-approaches-to-key-disclosure-for-country-or-region">Task 1: Research Aspect of Legal Approaches to Key Disclosure for Country or Region</h3>
<p>Each member of the start-up will act as resident expert for an aspect of the legal approach to key disclosure for a country region. Each team member should select and research one of the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Legal approach to key disclosure for country or region.</strong> An overview of the case study in terms of main points and novel aspects. Starting question: What aspect of key disclosure legislation was utilised by authorities in the investigation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Motivation for legal approach in the country or region.</strong> The stated or assumed motivation for adopting the legal approach by authorities in the country or region. Starting question: What was the motivation or rationale for adopting the legal approach to undermine encryption?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Impact of the legal approach in the country or region.** The actual or envisioned impact of the key disclosure legislation in the country or region on and its consequence for future investigations. Starting question: What was the implications of the key disclosure legislation from on subsequent investigation procedures? For example, have additional steps been added or processes refined?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ethical implications of the legal approach in the country or region.</strong> The realised or potential ethical implications from the use of the resulting key disclosure legislation. Starting question: What was the ethical implications that could negatively impact wider society and culture?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Novel application of the legal approach in the country or region.</strong> A case study of the legal approach applied in the country or region to undermine encryption. Starting question: What makes the case study a strong example of the particular legal approach compared to other countries?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Expert members have been provided with starting questions for each research area, but should not feel constrained by these questions.</p>
<h3 id="task-2-expert-discussion-on-specific-aspect-of-legal-approaches-to-key-disclosure-for-country-or-region">Task 2: Expert discussion on Specific Aspect of Legal Approaches to Key Disclosure for Country or Region</h3>
<p>Each expert member should meet with the expert member from other start-ups and discuss the specific aspect they have researched. Each expert member should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Share what they have discovered from their research.</strong> Expert members should share the salient and interesting aspects of what they have learned from their research on legal approaches for the country or region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Articulate expert presentation for start-up.</strong> Expert members should share the presentation they are going to present to their start-up to get feedback and support from other expert members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support and provide feedback to other experts.</strong> Expert members should provide feedback and support to other experts in shaping their presentation to their start-up firms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Experts should reflect on the feedback they received and what they have observed in their expert discussion session when refining their expert presentation. Experts should recall that their start-up firms are relying on their presentation of research into the specific aspect of legal approaches to undermine encryption for the country or region that they performed.</p>
<h3 id="task-3-experts-presentation-to-start-ups">Task 3: Experts presentation to start-ups.</h3>
<p>Experts should return to their start-up firm and give their presentation. The leader of the firm should then determine the appropriate running order and ask each expert within the start-up firm to present their research. The leader of the start-up firm should encourage members to ask questions as well as ensure that presentations and questions for a particular aspect do not exceed <strong>10</strong> minutes.</p>
<h3 id="task-4-produce-presentation-for-class">Task 4: Produce presentation for class</h3>
<p>Start-up firms are required to produce a <strong>FIVE</strong> by <strong>FIVE</strong> presentation, that is a presentation with <strong>FIVE</strong> slides that must not exceed <strong>FIVE</strong> minutes. Start-up firms are required produce a presentation with five slides that covers the five specific research areas. The five slides are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>**Overview of Legal Approach for Country or Region [1 minute].**  An overview of the specific key disclosure laws for the country or region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Motivation for adopting legal approach [1 minute].**  Outline the stated or assumed motivation for adopting the legal approach by authorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Novel application of the legal approach [1 minute].</strong> Overview of the interesting aspects or distinct aspects of the legal approach or novel application of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Impact [1 minute].**  The actual or envisioned impact of the key disclosure legislation on the wider world and its consequence for future investigations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Ethical implications [1 minute].**  The realised or potential ethical implications from the use of the resulting key disclosure legislation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Teams are permitted to include additional slides that they briefly consider, those slides are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Title Slide</em> [10 - 20 seconds]. Team name, members and matriculation numbers.</li>
<li><em>Bibliography</em> [10 - 20 seconds]. References for supporting evidence, any established citation style permitted.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="task-5-start-up-firms-to-present-to-class">Task 5: Start-up firms to present to class</h3>
<p>Start-up firms are required to present their research to class. The leader should introduce the presentation, team members as well as highlight the bibliography slide that points to supporting evidence. The leader should ensure the team keeps to time as instructed by lecturer.</p>
<p>The lecturer will advise when to commence and will signal when <strong>ONE</strong> minute is left. The class will clap the team off the stage at the five minute point as led by the lecturer.</p>
<p>Start-up firms should consider how to past between each member and how they will introduce themselves to peers. Teams are not expected to take questions during the presentation, but may be called upon during any subsequent discussion.</p>
<h4 id="audience">Audience</h4>
<p>Start-up firms when not presenting are expected to be present and listening to the presentation given by other teams. Presentation slides generated by teams will be issued after the session complete but individuals should still make notes to support subsequent discussions.</p>
<h3 id="task-6-identify-emerging-themes">Task 6: Identify Emerging themes</h3>
<p>Start-up firms should spend <strong>10</strong> minutes discussing and recalling the presentations from other start-up firms and begin to identify at least <strong>THREE</strong> emerging themes that were common across many or all of the presentations. Start-up firms should also consider in whats way do the legal approaches diverge and identify the most interesting divergence.</p>
<p>Start-up firms should produce a <strong>ONE</strong> slide presentation that prioritises and describes THREE emerging themes as well as ONE novel divergence.</p>
<p>Start-up firms should use the following concepts as starting points in the consideration of different emerging themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>**Self incrimination.** It is widely accepted that an individual has the privilege to not expose themselves to a criminal penalty or charge. Does the act of demonstrate knowledge of a key or process serve to incriminate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Right to silence</strong> Many jurisdictions support the right to silence, in that an individual has the right to not answer a question. Does the act of revealing a key or process to decrypt, infringe on that right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Key disclosure versus decrypted data.** Key disclosure can be widely consider the process to turn the intelligible into the comprehensible. Consequently, what is more important for authorities to have access to the key or the data itself?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Deniable encryption.** Individuals may expect the option of plausible deniability in some scenarios. Consequently, how does the key disclosure law facility or support such a scenario?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time limited decryption.</strong> There are many aspects of law, that are time limited. Does the the legislation itself consider the idea of time limits on compelled decryption?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Torture.</strong> Rubber-hose cryptanalysis where an individual is tortured to force decryption is an approach that could be used. Does the use of legislation prevent torture from happening?</p>
</li>
</ul>
