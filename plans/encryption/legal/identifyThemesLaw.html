        <h2 id="task-identify-emerging-themes">Task: Identify Emerging themes</h2>
<p>Start-up firms should spend <strong>TEN</strong> minutes discussing and recalling the presentations from other teams and begin to identify at least <strong>THREE</strong> emerging themes that were common across many or all of the presentations.</p>
<p>Teams should also consider in what ways do the legal approaches diverge and identify the most interesting divergences.</p>
<p>Start-up firms should produce a <strong>ONE</strong> slide presentation that prioritises and describes <strong>THREE</strong> emerging themes as well as <strong>ONE</strong> novel divergence.</p>
<p>Teams should use the following concepts as starting points in the consideration of different emerging themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>**Self incrimination.** It is widely accepted that an individual has the privilege to not expose themselves to a criminal penalty or charge. Starting question: Does the act of demonstrating knowledge of a key or process serve to incriminate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Right to silence</strong> Many jurisdictions support the right to silence, in that an individual has the right to not answer a question. Starting question: Does the act of revealing a key or process to decrypt, infringe on that right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Key disclosure versus decrypted data.**  Key disclosure can be widely considered the process to turn the intelligible into the comprehensible. Starting question: What is more important for authorities to have access to? The key or the data itself?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Deniable encryption.**  Individuals may expect the option of plausible deniability in some scenarios. Starting question: How does the key disclosure law facilitate or support such a scenario?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time limited decryption.</strong> There are many aspects of law, that are time limited. Starting question: Does the the legislation itself consider the idea of time limits on compelled decryption?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Torture.</strong> Rubber-hose cryptanalysis where an individual is tortured to force decryption is an approach that could be used. Starting question: Does the use of legislation prevent torture from happening?</p>
</li>
</ul>
