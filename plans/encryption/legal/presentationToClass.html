<p>Start-up firms are required to present their research to class. The leader should introduce the presentation, team members as well as highlight the bibliography slide that points to supporting evidence. The leader should ensure the team keeps to time as instructed by lecturer.</p>
<p>The lecturer will advise when to commence and will signal when <strong>ONE</strong> minute is left. The class will clap the team off the stage at the five minute point as led by the lecturer.</p>
<p>Start-up firms should consider how to past between each member and how they will introduce themselves to peers. Teams are not expected to take questions during the presentation, but may be called upon during any subsequent discussion.</p>
<h4 id="audience">Audience</h4>
<p>Start-up firms when not presenting are expected to be present and listening to the presentation given by other teams. Presentation slides generated by teams will be issued after the session complete but individuals should still make notes to support subsequent discussions.</p>
