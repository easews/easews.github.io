<p>Teams should identify a case study of a technical approach being used to undermine encryption for the purposes of digital investigations.</p>
<p>Team members should produce a brief summary, no more than 250 words, that considers the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Overview of case study.</strong> An overview of the case study and the specific technical approach utilised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Novel and/or interesting aspects for domain.</strong> The novel and/or interesting aspects of the technical approach used in the domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Motivation for favouring case study.</strong> The rationale and motivation for selecting the case study and why the team should consider it as their primary case study to research and investigate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each team member must also identify <strong>FIVE</strong> artefacts that act as source material for the case study.</p>
<p>The artefacts can be anything, from research articles, videos, audio recordings or a mixture. Teams will rely upon the artefacts as source material if the case is selected.</p>
<p>Team members should provide their team with the summaries and each member should spend <strong>TEN</strong> minutes considering them and prioritising the case studies they favour, producing the top three case studies they want to consider (excluding their own).</p>
<p>Teams should gather and share their rankings before agreeing on the case study they want to consider in more depth.</p>
