<p>Specific Context
Teams should identify a specific context and confirm with instructor prior to commencing any research as to minimise duplication across teams.</p>
<p>Teams should consult the country list or domain list in Appendix A and Appendix B, respectively.</p>
<p>Quiz
Individuals will be expected to complete a post presentation continuous assessment, in the form of a multiple-choice quiz. The quiz will probe the audience’s awareness and alertness to the case studies presented by the class.</p>
<p>The quiz comprises of 10 multiple choice questions with four answers, there is only one optimal answer in each case with the other three acting as viable distractors. Individuals have a single attempt and 10 minutes to complete the assessment. Each correct response is awarded one mark, no response receives no marks and an incorrect response is deducted 1/3 mark.</p>
<p>eams should carefully consider and discuss each case study when categorising as case studies may fall into two categories or may actually be more accurately represented by one than the other. For example, the private element relied upon by the encryption approach could be obtained because of poor understanding of implementation actions taken rather than explicit poor implementation decisions.</p>
<p>Teams in classifying the different case studies should also consider the themes that emerge from consideration of several of the cases. Teams will almost certainly identify their own themes, but some starting themes may include:</p>
<p>Oscillating popularity over time of favoured category approach. The popularity of different technical approaches could varying over time, depending on various factors. For examples, exploiting algorithmic errors in encryption may have been favoured historically, before progressing on to favour exploitation of implementation errors.</p>
<p>Popularity of favoured category approach varies by context. The popularity of different technical approaches could varying to different countries or domains. For example, exploiting administrative errors may be favoured for the financial sector.</p>
<p>Platform influences popularity of favoured category approach. The favoured technical approach for undermining encryption could be influenced by a specific platform or service. For example, exploiting an implementation error in encryption may be favoured for messaging services.</p>
<p>Teams should carefully consider the themes that emerge from consideration of the case studies. Teams should agree on at least three potential themes or lessons learned from consideration of the case studies.</p>
<p>Workload Record
Teams have the opportunity to produce a one-page workload record that reflects the contributions of each team member. Teams do not utilise the opportunity to provide a workload record then it is assumed that all team members contributed equally.</p>
<p>Team members are encouraged to positively contribute their contributions to the activity rather document the activities of others.</p>
