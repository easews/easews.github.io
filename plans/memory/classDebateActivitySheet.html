<p>The position is:</p>
<p><em>Live forensics analysis has many benefits, but comes with many risks. The risks in almost all situations ensure that live forensics is not a viable option for digital investigations. Investigations should not conduct live forensics analysis.</em></p>
<h3 id="task-prepare-for-class-debate">Task: Prepare for Class Debate.</h3>
<p>Learners should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Confirm with the lecturer, the team number and if they are to adopt the affirmative or negative position within the debate. Odd number teams should defend the affirmative position while even number teams should define the negative position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spend at least <strong>30</strong> minutes discussing potentially remarks and points and then subdivide the work into various packages. The team should use the individual summaries generated as part of the prior activity to inform the arguments and points they will focus on. The team should decide collectively whether each work package should be tackled in pairs or by individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a team, devise a shared space and collate the evidence list and summaries from each member as the best starting point for strengthening the arguments and points point forward by the team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reconvene as a group and devise and organise and refine arguments for the assigned position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Group arguments into <em>primary</em>, <em>secondary</em> and <em>rebuttal</em> groupings. Primary arguments should be considered the strongest, with secondary arguments being positions that reinforce or cement primary argument. Teams should also anticipate the potential arguments raised by the opposing force. Teams will have <strong>THREE</strong> to present primary arguments, <strong>THREE</strong> minutes to reinforce position with secondary arguments and <strong>THREE</strong> minutes for rebuttals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare evidence for each of the arguments, teams are required to submit a copy of the evidence at the point of presentation to the instructor and opposing team.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="task-participate-in-class-debate">Task: Participate in Class Debate</h3>
<p>Team members may only speak within one round of the debate and all team members must participate. Teams can determine the order of presenters.</p>
<p>The lecturer or instructor will advise of the overall structure of the debate, but teams should have prepared primary, secondary and potential arguments as well as supporting evidence in advance of the debate.</p>
