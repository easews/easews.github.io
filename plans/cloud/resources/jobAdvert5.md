## Deliver game-changing digital forensics
Digital forensics are vital to the success of Counter Terrorism Policing (CTP) in London and beyond. Join us as a Digital Forensics Examiner, and you’ll be applying your skills to some of the most important and high profile investigations in the country – investigations that are right at the heart of CTP, and our nation’s safety and security.

This is a key role that will see you using a range of established digital forensics techniques to identify relevant data and files for our Counter Terrorism investigations as well as drawing upon your forensic and investigative skills to add context in terms of how the data was created, by whom and when – all while considering how the data impacts our wider objectives. That’s going to involve preparing and presenting technical evidential reports and statements in a form that’s clear and easy to understand, as well as extracting specific data for assessment. Your responsibilities will also encompass using specialist tools to make forensically sound copies; making links between suspects and digital evidence; and outlining how a device was configured so we can see exactly what was created, viewed, sent and received.

With a sound theoretical knowledge and solid practical experience, you’ll be adept at applying your digital forensic skills to acquire, exploit and secure evidence of data from digital devices. Future-focused, you’ll always be looking at how we can apply the latest technologies to keep people safe. Just as important as your technical skills are your communication abilities – you’ll have the confidence to present your work at court as part of some exceptionally high profile investigations.

This is a critical, highly visible role that will enable you to make your digital forensics skills count on a huge scale.
