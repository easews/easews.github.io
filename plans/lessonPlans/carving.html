        <h1 id="content-carving-active-lesson-plan">Content Carving Active Lesson Plan</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The lesson plan considers data acquisition challenges in terms of content carving. The activity plan is for individuals to develop an initial awareness of the fundamental theory and concepts surrounding <strong>file and content carving</strong>. A <a href="../resources/carving.m4v">overview video</a> outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>File (content) carving is the process of recovering and reconstructing file content directly from block storage without using the filesystem metadata. More generally, data (structure) carving is the process of reconstructing logical objects (such as files and database records) from a bulk data capture (disk/RAM image) without using metadata that describes the location and layout of the artifacts. <a href="https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/Forensics_v1.0.1.pdf">CyBOK Forensics Knowledge Area P(19)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>Learners complete <strong>FOUR</strong> blocks of activities that are designed to support them in appreciating the significant challenging in recovering and reconstructing files. Instructors support learners through the following activity blocks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Acquisition in Untrusted and Unknown Environments.</strong> The first block is a brief lecture on the significant concepts of file and content carving, in terms of when the file system can not be trusted, relied upon or is unknown. in the situation when the file system is unknown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No fragmentation, Bifragmented and Interleaved file content carving.</strong> The second block considers the different arrangements of file blocks on the file system. It is important for investigators to be aware of the arrangement of file blocks on the file system as it informs the approach to recover them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiple Interleaved File Fragementation.</strong> The third block of activities supports learners in considering the challenge of multiple interleaved file fragments in more depth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content carving.</strong> The fourth block is used to conclude the active lesson plan and is focused on aligning the outcomes of the activities with material presented in the CyBOK.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="qualification-level">Qualification Level</h3>
<p>The active lesson plan can be adjusted to accommodate many of the United Kingdom qualification levels. In its current form the active lesson plan is targeting learners at Levels 6 and 7 on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) and Credit and Qualifications Framework (CQFW) in England and Wales, Levels 10 and 11 on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) and Levels 6 and 7 on European Qualifications Framework (EQF).</p>
<p>The active lesson plan does not expect nor require an individual to posses significant knowledge in Computing Science, Mathematics or Law.</p>
