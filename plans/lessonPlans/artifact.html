        <h1 id="authenticating-identifying-and-triaging-data-active-lesson-plan">Authenticating, Identifying and Triaging Data Active Lesson Plan</h1>
<p>This active lesson plan considers artifact analysis from the perspective of applying hash functions to authenticate evidence and identify contraband as well as how hash functions can be used to filter and triage data as part of an investigation. A <a href="../resources/artifact.m4v">overview video</a> outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cryptographic hashing is the first tool of choice when investigating any case; it provides a basic means of validating data integrity and identifying known artifacts. Recall that a hash function takes an arbitrary string of binary data and produces a number, often referred to as a digest, within a predefined range. Ideally, given a set of different inputs, the hash function will map them onto different outputs. <a href="https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/Forensics_v1.0.1.pdf">CyBOK Forensics Knowledge Area P(28)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<p>Learners complete <strong>FIVE</strong> blocks of activities that are designed to support them in developing understanding and awareness of applying hash functions in forensics. Using a real-world case as a staring point, instructors support learning through the following activity blocks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Overview of Hash Functions.</strong> The first block of activities supports learners in understanding some of the applications and qualities of hash functions from consideration of actual cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authentication of Evidence.</strong> The second block of activities supports learners in appreciating the use of hash function in terms of authentication of evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identification of Contraband.</strong> The third block of activities are designed around supporting learners in appreciating how hash functions can be used in forensics to identify contraband.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Same vs Similar.</strong> The fourth block of activities are designed to support learners in appreciating the opportunities and challenges in applying hash functions to support digital investigations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash Functions in Forensics.</strong> The fifth and final block is designed to conclude the active lesson plan and align material with that presented in the CyBOK.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="qualification-level">Qualification Level</h3>
<p>The active lesson plan can be adjusted to accommodate many of the United Kingdom qualification levels. In its current form the active lesson plan is targeting learners at Levels 6 and 7 on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) and Credit and Qualifications Framework (CQFW) in England and Wales, Levels 10 and 11 on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) and Levels 6 and 7 on European Qualifications Framework (EQF).</p>
<p>The active lesson plan does not expect nor require an individual to posses significant knowledge in Computing Science, Mathematics or Law.</p>
