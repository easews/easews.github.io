        <h1 id="system-state-active-lesson-plan">System State Active Lesson Plan</h1>
<p>This active lesson plan considers analysis of system state using volatile main memory. The active lesson plan is designed to support individuals in developing an initial awareness of the value of system state to an investigation. An <a href="../resources/memory.m4v">overview video</a> outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The early view of best forensic practices was to literally pull the plug on a machine that was to be impounded. The rationale was that this would remove any possibility of alerting the processes running on the host and would preempt any attempts to hide information. Over time, experience has shown that these concerns were largely exaggerated and that the substantial and irreversible loss of important forensic information such as open connections and encryption keys was rarely justified. <a href="https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/Forensics_v1.0.1.pdf">CyBOK Forensics Knowledge Area P(21)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>Learners complete <strong>THREE</strong> blocks of activities that are designed to support them in appreciating the benefits as well as risks in analysing volatile memory. Using a real-world case as a staring point, instructors support learning through the following activity blocks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Memory Analysis.</strong> The first block of activities supports learners in appreciating the benefit and risks to memory analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investigation of System Run-time State.</strong> The second block of activities will afford learners the opportunity to apply knowledge from the CyBOK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Summary of System State Analysis.</strong> The third and final block is used to conclude the active lesson plan and relate activities back to material in the <a href="https://www.cybok.org">CyBOK</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="qualification-level">Qualification Level</h3>
<p>The active lesson plan can be adjusted to accommodate many of the United Kingdom qualification levels. In its current form the active lesson plan is targeting learners at Levels 6 and 7 on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) and Credit and Qualifications Framework (CQFW) in England and Wales, Levels 10 and 11 on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) and Levels 6 and 7 on European Qualifications Framework (EQF).</p>
<p>The active lesson plan does not expect nor require an individual to posses significant knowledge in Computing Science, Mathematics or Law.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="overview-of-main-memory-analysis-presentation">Overview of Main Memory Analysis [Presentation]</h3>
<p>The session begins with a brief lecture on the theory and relevant concepts related to volatile memory analysis.</p>
<p>Learners will use this knowledge to appreciate the upcoming challenges in securing viable evidence and how this contrasts to the traditional mindset in Forensics of operating on non-live systems.</p>
<h4 id="instructions">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Present their own lecture on memory analysis as an approach to secure evidence valuable and relevant to a Forensics investigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permit time for questions to address any misconceptions or issues with the material presented.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="produce-summary-of-case-study-assignment">Produce Summary of Case Study [Assignment]</h3>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should set learners the assignment to produce a summary of the case that will act as the foundation for activities. The assignment will act as an <em>entry ticket assignment</em> and those learners that do not complete the assignment are not able to participate in the session or miss the opportunity to gain course credit.</p>
<p>Optional: the instructor can set the assignment as an activity at the start of the session.</p>

<h4 id="instructions-1">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Advise learners that the class is going to debate the merits of whether Boucher should surrender his password or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue the practice debate activity sheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue summary previously collected from learners that they generated from summarising the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Randomly label learners, either A or B, and advise them to self-organise into pairs of A and B.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise all learners labelled 'A' that they have to advocate the affirmative position. Consequently, all learners labelled 'B' are to adopt the negative position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise the class that pairs they have <strong>30</strong> minutes to prepare their arguments for their position and they will be provided with a <strong>FIVE</strong> warning before time elapses. After time has elapsed pairs will be numbered and selected at random to make their position clear to the class. Each learner will have <strong>FOUR</strong> minutes to make their argument to the class. Their partner will review and provide feedback to their partner before the wider class to do the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=random+number+generator">random number generator</a> to randomly select pairs to present. The lecturer may favour to select pairs on what they have observed, rather than randomly, to demonstrate and discuss with the entire class any novel insights or gaps in understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask the partner of the leaner to provide feedback inline with guidance on the activity sheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the question to the wider class, do not use an audience response system for the activity. Ask the class to raise their hand to offer any feedback to the learner in line with the guidance on the activity sheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise the partner of the learner, it is now their time to provide their position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat process of asking the respective partner to provide feedback and then the class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify another pair to perform the debate, continue in this fashion until a sufficient number of perspectives and positions have been considered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflect on the debate as a whole with the class. Provide general feedback in terms of the debate that has been so far witnessed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conclude activity by advising learners the present activity was a practice debate to get feedback and will be helpful for subsequent activities.</p>

<p>Learners will consider <strong>THREE</strong> scenarios where consideration of volatile memory may be valuable as part of the forensics investigation.</p>
<p>The aim is to provide learners an opportunity to develop insight into the different scenarios where consideration of volatile memory may be valuable but also the risks involved in conducting such analysis, in terms of compromising a forensics investigation.</p>
<h4 id="instructions-2">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Advise learners they are going to independently consider a number of case studies and select one for further inquiry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise learners to consider or focus on the significance of live analysis, whether it was optimal or necessary in the given context and whether risks were considered in adopting the approach. Advise learners they should source high-quality evidence to support their critique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise learners they should produce a summary of no more than <strong>250</strong> word as well as additional sources of evidence to support their position.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="system-state-analysis">System State Analysis</h2>
<p>The <strong>THIRD</strong> and final block of activities affords learners the opportunity to gain insight into the analysis of system state and how that can contribute to an investigation in forensics.</p>
<p>The activities are structured in-line with material from the <a href="https://www.cybok.org">CyBOK</a>, specifically in terms of system run-time state, i.e. processes, network connections, artifacts and fragments as well as file information.</p>
<p>The activity block is based off of <a href="/general/sources.html">several documented</a> texts, tutorials and workshops around using the open-source <a href="https://www.volatilityfoundation.org">Volatility Framework</a> analysing a capture of a memory file containing the Cridex malware. The activity block is designed so that it can be executed without the lecturer or instructor using any framework or tool. Alternatively, the lecturer or instructor may act as a <em><strong>puppet instructor</strong></em> and perform live analysis or configure a lab to allow a focused technical class centred around the material.</p>
<h3 id="block-structure-1">Block structure</h3>
<p>The block is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Overview of System State Analysis [Presentation].</strong> Instructor provides a brief lecture on the significant concepts of system state analysis and relevance in digital investigations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Produce Summary of Case Study [Assignment].</strong> Learners are required to produce a summary of the case being considered in the class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Overview of Case [Presentation].</strong> Instructor provides an overview of the case to the class to ensure every learner is starting from the same point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Processes [Activity].</strong> Class first considers the processes that were executing on the system when an image of main memory was captured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Network Connections [Activity].</strong> Class then considers the open network connections that were utilised by the processes that were identified as interesting from the previous block of activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Artifacts and Fragments [Activity].</strong> Class then considers the artifacts and fragments relevant to the processes and open network connections previously identified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>File Information [Activity].</strong> Class lastly considers the extracted executable itself that has been identified from previously considered processes, network connections and relevant artifacts as well as fragments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Summary of System State Analysis [Presentation].</strong> Conclude the session and motivate learners to consider the activities completed and relate them back to the CyBOK.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="overview-of-system-state-analysis-presentation">Overview of System State Analysis [Presentation]</h3>
<p>The session begins with a brief lecture on the significant concepts of information processing, in terms of triaging information as well as how to reduce and expand data where relevant within the context of digital investigations.</p>
<p>Learners will use this material as well as consideration of the case study to intimately consider the major information processing steps in digital investigations.</p>
<h4 id="instructions-7">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>

<h3 id="processes-activity">Processes [Activity]</h3>
<p>The aim of the block of activities if for the class to consider the processes that were executing at the point when an image of volatile memory was captured from the system. There are several tutorials and resources available to support such activity and this activity is based on these <a href="../about/references.html">sources</a>.</p>
<p>The expectation is that learners will come to learn how to use such information to set and steer investigations of system state.</p>
<h4 id="instructions-8">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Advise learners that the class is going to consider a previously capture image of volatile memory from a system. The first step will be to consider the processes that were executing on the system at the point of capture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Either demonstrate live analysis of the image using the <a href="https://www.volatilityfoundation.org">Volatility Framework</a> and  <code>pslist</code> or inform this has been done in advance of the session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue the <a href="../memory/processList.html">Process List Activity Sheet</a> to learners and advise them they have <strong>15</strong> minutes to research and investigate the processes and identify any aspects that are curious or would prompt further investigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After time has elapsed advise learners to self-organise into pairs and spend <strong>10</strong> minutes compare their investigations of the processes, share insights as well as tackle any misconceptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After time has elapsed, use an audience response system, such as <a href="https://www.mentimeter">Mentimeter</a>, and ask pairs to suggest any interesting aspects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise the class, if it has not surfaced from the audience, that:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The majority of processes are either system critical or relevant to the Microsoft Windows Operating System, for example <code>Explorer.exe</code> with Process ID <code>1484</code>.</li>
<li>The process are executing in session <code>0</code> which would indicate an older version of the Microsoft Windows Operating System.</li>
<li>There is seemingly only one potential process from an external vendor, i.e. <code>reader_sl.exe</code> with Process ID <code>1640</code>, that has a Parent Process ID of <code>1484</code>.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Advise the class that the next step will be to visualise the processes in terms of parent and child relationships. Either demonstrate live analysis of the image using the <a href="https://www.volatilityfoundation.org">Volatility Framework</a> and  <code>pstree</code> or inform this has been done in advance of the session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise learners to remain in pairs and issue the <a href="../memory/processTree.html">Process Tree Activity Tree</a>. Advise pairs they have <strong>15</strong> minutes to document the relationships between the processes. Advise pairs they will be given a <strong>ONE</strong> minute warning before time elapses and that a pair will be selected at random to present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wander between the pairs of learners to gain insight as well as offer any help and support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After time has elapsed, use a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=random+number+generator">random number generator</a> to randomly select pairs to present. The lecturer may favour to select pairs on what they have observed, rather than randomly, to demonstrate and discuss with the entire class any novel insights or gaps in understanding.</p>
</li>

Advise learners to consider the notes and areas of interest from previous activity blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The process is <code>POST</code>ing information through the open network connection, suggesting data is being exfiltrated from the system.</li>
