        <h1 id="applications-and-user-actions-lesson-plan">Applications and User Actions Lesson Plan</h1>
<p>The lesson plan considers the significance of applications as valuable sources of user interactions that can act as valuable and powerful evidence within the legal process. The active lesson plan scaffolds leaners in developing understanding and awareness around the <strong>value of applications</strong> in terms of <strong>user interactions</strong> and this is relevant to Forensics. A <a href="../resources/application.m4v">overview video</a> outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Application forensics is the process of establishing a data-centric theory of operation for a specific application. The goal of the analysis is to objectively establish causal dependencies between data input and output, as a function of the user interactions with the application. Depending on whether an application is an open or closed source and on the level of the accompanying documentation, the analytical effort required can vary from reading detailed specifications to reverse engineering code, data structures and communication protocols, to performing time-consuming black box differential analysis experiments. Alternatively, forensic tool vendors may license code from the application vendor to gain access to the proprietary data structures. The big advantage of analysing applications is that we have a better chance of observing and documenting direct evidence of user actions, which is of primary importance to the legal process.
<a href="https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/Forensics_v1.0.1.pdf">CyBOK Forensic Knowledge Area. Pg 23.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>Learners complete <strong>FOUR</strong> blocks of activities that are designed to support them in appreciating the significance of applications in terms of repositories of user interactions. Using real-world applications and a relevant case, instructors support learners through the following activity blocks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Application Forensics.</strong> The first block of activities supports learners in appreciating the benefit and risks to application forensics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Case Study: Web Browser.</strong> The second block of activities supports learners in the valuable information that can be learned from a popular application with individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Study of Web Search History.</strong> The third and block of activities will afford learners the opportunity to apply knowledge from prior activities and relate to a relevant case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application Usage as Evidence.</strong> The fourth and final block is used to conclude the active lesson plan and is focused on aligning the outcomes of the activities with material presented in the CyBOK.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="qualification-level">Qualification Level</h3>
<p>The active lesson plan can be adjusted to accommodate many of the United Kingdom qualification levels. In its current form the active lesson plan is targeting learners at Levels 6 and 7 on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) and Credit and Qualifications Framework (CQFW) in England and Wales, Levels 10 and 11 on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) and Levels 6 and 7 on European Qualifications Framework (EQF).</p>
<p>The active lesson plan does not expect nor require an individual to posses significant knowledge in Computing Science, Mathematics or Law.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="application-forensics">Application Forensics</h2>
<p>The <strong>FIRST</strong> block of activities supports learners in appreciating the benefit and risks to application forensics.</p>
<h3 id="block-structure">Block Structure</h3>
<p>The block is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>User Interactions and Applications [Presentation].</strong> The lecturer or instructor provides a brief lecture or overview on the significance of user interactions with application as they relate to the legal process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unicorn Pitch [Activity].</strong> Learners will form teams and pitch a successful application that will enable to become a Unicorn start-up, that is a rare and valuable company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blueprint for Good Applications from the Forensic Investigator Perspective [Activity].</strong> Learners will form new teams to identify common criteria for permitting applications in an Enterprise from the perspective of a Forensics investigator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unicorns vs Investigators [Activity].</strong> Learners will identify the opportunities and obstacles in using application data as part of a forensics investigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Class Discussion on Using Application Data [Activity].</strong> The class will consider and discuss some of the common potential opportunities and obstacles identified by teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Opportunities and Obstacles in using Application Data [Presentation].</strong> The activity block will conclude by relating activity outputs with material in the CyBOK.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="user-interactions-and-applications-presentation">User Interactions and Applications [Presentation].</h3>
<p>The session begins with a brief lecture or overview on the significance of user interactions with application as they relate to the legal process.</p>
<p>Learners will use this material to appreciate the opportunities and challenges around application forensics.</p>
<h4 id="instructions">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Present their own admissibility lecture or provide in advance for students to consider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permit time for questions to address any misconceptions or issues with the material presented.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="unicorn-pitch-activity">Unicorn Pitch [Activity]</h3>
<p>The aim of the activity is to focus learners on considering their prior knowledge and thoughts, in terms of building a successful start-up application. The expectation is that learners will come to consider applications from primarily two perspectives: that of the user and that of the provider.</p>
<p>In terms of the user, in what the qualities and feature they seek and what would engage them with the application. In terms of the business, what drives individuals to engage with their application and business model they will employ. These aspects relate back to the CyBOK in terms of ensuring learners appreciate that while valuable user data may be generated it may not be easily accessible due to business model choices.</p>
<h4 id="instructions-1">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Advise learners they have to self-organise into teams of no more than <strong>FOUR</strong> members and no less than <strong>THREE</strong> members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise teams they have <strong>30</strong> minutes to produce a <strong>TWO</strong> minute pitch with accompanying single presentation slide for an application for a given market that will enable them as start-up to be classed as a Unicorn. A company that is effectively rare given its perceived value. Advise learners they have few restrictions, other than the application must be focused at the consumer market and most be realistic in its claims and benefits, for example the application can not predict future lottery results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wander between teams as they form and create their ideas and companies. Motivate learners to consider the perspective of users and of business owners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collect the presentation slides from teams and collate them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=random+number+generator">random number generator</a> to randomly select teams to present. The lecturer may favour to select teams on what they have observed as to shape the discussion in a particular direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remind teams they have <strong>TWO</strong> minutes to present and led the class in applause by clapping the teams off when time has elapsed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue to call teams until a sufficient number of pitches have been presented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise teams to spend <strong>10</strong> minutes reflecting on the pitches they have observed as well as their pitch. Advise them to identify <strong>FIVE</strong> qualities that make for a successful application, either from the perspective of user engagement or business rationale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue a <strong>ONE</strong> minute warning before time elapses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collect the <strong>FIVE</strong> qualities from teams and advise them the material will be used in subsequent activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permit time for questions to address any misconceptions or issues that emerged during the session.</p>

<h3 id="blueprint-for-good-applications-from-the-forensic-investigator-perspective-activity">Blueprint for Good Applications from the Forensic Investigator Perspective [Activity]</h3>
<p>The aim of the activity is to motivate learners to consider what would make a good application from the perspective of a forensic investigator. The expectation is that learners will come to consider that will extensive user engagement and logging may prove valuable data, gaining access to that data, how it is generated and the level of volume also presents challenges.</p>
<h4 id="instructions-2">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Advise learners they have to self-organise into teams of no more than <strong>FOUR</strong> members and no less than <strong>THREE</strong> members. The members of the team should be different than the prior activity. The rationale is this will afford learners an opportunity to interact with other members of the class but also present a break from the though-process in the previous activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise teams they have <strong>30</strong> minutes to produce a <strong>TWO</strong> minute pitch with accompanying single presentation slide for criteria for permissible applications for a large multinational company. Emphasise to teams they are producing criteria from the perspective of a forensics investigator, not from the perspective of a manager or security engineer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wander between teams as they form and create their ideas and companies. Support learners in reflecting and balancing the challenge of extensive user engagement data and gaining accessing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collect the presentation slides from teams and collate them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=random+number+generator">random number generator</a> to randomly select teams to present. The lecturer may favour to select teams on what they have observed as to shape the discussion in a particular direction.</p>

<li>
<p>Continue to call teams until a sufficient number of pitches have been presented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise teams to spend <strong>10</strong> minutes reflecting on the pitches they have observed as well as their pitch. Advise them to identify <strong>FIVE</strong> common criteria that would satisfy most of the pitches they observed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue a <strong>ONE</strong> minute warning before time elapses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collect the <strong>FIVE</strong> common criteria  from teams and advise them the material will be used in subsequent activities.</p>

<h3 id="unicorns-vs-investigators-activity">Unicorns vs Investigators [Activity]</h3>
<p>Teams will use their collective notes, their own research and other team pitches to identify the opportunities and challenges around using application data as part of a forensics investigation.</p>
<h4 id="instructions-3">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Advise teams that they are to produce a <strong>ONE</strong> slide presentation that covers <strong>THREE</strong> opportunities for application data in forensics and <strong>THREE</strong> obstacles or challenges in using that application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue the start-up pitches and common criteria produced by all teams from the prior activities to the class. Advise teams they have <strong>30</strong> minutes to produce their slides and can use their own research, collective notes and outputs from prior activities to produce the slide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As teams produce their slides, the lecturer should wander between groups to observe discussion and actions.</p>

<h4 id="instructions-4">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=random+number+generator">random number generator</a> to randomly select teams to present. The lecturer may favour to select teams on what they have observed as to shape the discussion in a particular direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise teams they have <strong>TWO</strong> minutes to present and they are only expected to present a <strong>SINGLE</strong> opportunity or obstacle, but not one that has already been raised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teams that do not have a unique opportunity or obstacle should be clapped-off without presenting to inject some engagement and humour into the session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a sufficient number of presentations, for example <strong>THREE</strong> presentations, pause and engage the wider class and discuss some of what has been presented.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>The lecturer or instructor should provide a brief summary of the <em>State of Indiana vs Gaylyn Morris</em> case to the class.</p>
<p>The motivation for providing the overview is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>address any misconceptions or gaps in understanding that students may have developed when considering the case in advance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support those students that have no adequately considered the case in advance as to ensure they can effectively contribute to the activity.</p>

<p>The aim of the activity is for the learners to gain insight into how to analysis and consider the search history of an individual from the perspective of a forensics investigation.</p>
<h4 id="instructions-12">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Issue the <a href="../application/stumpActivitySheet.html">Stump Activity Sheet</a> to learners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise learners they are going to create an application usage trail using
a web browser for the accused in the case study. Advise learners that in generating the trail they should aspects that have been previously considered, such as misinterpretation of data points, i.e. interpreting data of usage from one perspective without considering an alternative, as well as anti-forensics techniques, i.e. purposely counterfeiting exculpatory evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise learners that the class will vote on particularly creative, engaging and intelligent attempts at the activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise learners they have <strong>30</strong> minutes to generate the application usage data. Inform learners they will be issued a <strong>FIVE</strong> minute warning when time is nearly elapsed. Learners can generate the application data usage trail via:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pen and paper.</strong> Learners can generate the application usage data using pen and paper and completing a <a href="mockApplicationDataUsageSheet.html">Mock Application Data Usage Sheet</a> by hand.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheet.</strong> Learns can generate the application usage data using a digital system, such as a laptop or tablet, and completing a <a href="mockApplicationDataUsageSheet.html">Mock Application Data Usage Sheet</a> using a device.</li>
<li><strong>Web browser and appropriate tool.</strong> Learners can use a web browser, but should be advised to wipe to factory settings and generate the data and use an appropriate tool to generate the data, such as <a href="https://github.com/obsidianforensics/hindsight">Hindsight</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Walk through the class as learners perform their task and discuss the topic and the approach they are adopting. Issue each learner with a piece of paper and pen as they perform the task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After time has elapsed, advise learners to write their favourite colour on the paper in big lettering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise learners they are going to pair-up with another learner after time has elapsed. Inform them to wander around the class and pair-up with another learner that has the same favourite colour. If there any remaining learners, assign them to each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise learners to swap their application usage data with their new partner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise learners they have <strong>15</strong> minutes to assemble a convincing trail of usage data from the data providing, keeping in mind the tactics the other learner may have performed to <strong>stump</strong> them. Inform learners they will be issued a <strong>ONE</strong> minute warning when time is nearly elapsed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise pairs they have <strong>10</strong> minutes to exchange outlines of the trails uncovered and their interpretation of the data. Respective partners should communicate if this is correct or what the other has missed. Inform learners they will be issued a <strong>FIVE</strong> minute warning to swap around during the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise learners they can now choose to nominate their partner's stump, either because they observed a quality they would like to share with the class or discuss with the class. Advise learners if no-one nominates, pairs will be selected at random. Use an audience response system, such as <a href="https://www.mentimeter.com">Mentimeter</a>, or paper to collect nominations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select learners to present based on nominations or select learners if no nominations are received. Ask the learners to present their partner's stump and describe how they uncovered the trail, what their interpretation of it was and whether it is correct. Advise other learners to take notes as they observe the presentations.</p>

<h3 id="class-collective-identification-of-emerging-themes-of-using-application-usage-data-activity">Class Collective Identification of Emerging Themes of Using Application Usage Data [Activity]</h3>
<p>The aim is for the class to broadly identify emerging themes of using application data, specifically the elements of data that are valuable but also in terms of how these data points can be connected, in such a way that may be inaccurate and so must be carefully considered.</p>
<h4 id="instructions-13">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=random+number+generator">random number generator</a> to randomly select pairs to present. The lecturer may favour to select pairs on what they have observed, rather than randomly, to demonstrate and discuss with the entire class any novel insights or gaps in understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Briefly refresh the class on cases considered across the prior activities, emphasising examples of the data collected and how this has been interpreted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise pairs they have <strong>FIVE</strong> minutes to reflect on the notes they have made from the prior activities. Advise them to speak to their partner to resolve any misconceptions and gaps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the time has elapsed, advise pairs they have <strong>10</strong> minutes to generate a shared note that highlights the key elements of application usage that can be learned from application forensics, concerns around interpretation and any misconceptions that neither can satisfactorily resolve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify pairs at to random to stand-up and discuss <strong>ONE</strong> key element of application usage and concerns around interpretation of such usage from a forensics perspective. Ask one member of the pair to present it to the class while the other acts as note taker and writes the heading or name for the element on a white board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use an audience response system, such <a href="https://www.mentimeter.com">Mentimeter</a>, and ask the class if they have any additional thoughts around the strengths and concerns of using such elements of application usage data from a forensics perspective. Request the note taker to add some of the comments to the whiteboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank the pair of learners and identify another pair of learners. Advise the pair to share an element and concern, not previously discussed. Similarly, one learner should present while the other notes the heading on the whiteboard. The class should then be asked via an audience response system for any additional thoughts that the note taker can add to the board. Continue in this fashion until a sufficient number of elements have been considered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Summaries the key elements devised by the class and emphasise the more significant elements provided by leaners.</p>
