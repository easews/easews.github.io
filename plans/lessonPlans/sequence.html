        <h1 id="sequencing-events-and-information-processing-active-lesson-plan">Sequencing Events and Information Processing Active Lesson Plan</h1>
<p>This active lesson plan considers the <strong>steps</strong>, <strong>processes</strong> and <strong>loops</strong> an investigator performs when processing information as part of a digital investigation. An <a href="../resources/sequence.m4v">overview video</a> outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/Forensics_v1.0.1.pdf">CyBOK presents the Cognitive Task Model from Pirolli &amp; Card</a> as an approach to understand how digital investigators process information from external data sources to final presentation of evidence.</p>
<p>This active lesson plan scaffolds and supports learners in devising their own cognitive task model before comparing and contrasting it with the model presented in the CyBOK. The rationale for this approach is for learners to actively engage with the cognitive process that investigators perform when   extracting and analysing evidence, rather than just learning about it from the CyBOK.</p>
<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<p>Learners complete <strong>FOUR</strong> blocks of activities that are designed to support them in devising their own cognitive task model. Using a real-world case as a starting point, instructors support learning through the following activity blocks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cognitive Steps in Information Processing.</strong> The first block of activities supports learners in devising and understanding the fundamental steps to process information from external data sources to the final presentation of evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Processes.</strong> The second block of activities supports learners in devising and understanding the abstraction and analytical processes that are used to progress between the major information processing steps (devised in the prior block of activities).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loops.</strong> The third block of activities supports learners in appreciating the analytical information processing loops that are required to refine and improve evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cognitive Task Model.</strong> The fourth and final block of activities closes the lesson plan and learners consider the Cognitive Task Model from the CyBOK. Learners compare and contrast the model devised through activities in the lesson plan with those presented in the CyBOK.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="qualification-level">Qualification Level</h3>
<p>The active lesson plan can be adjusted to accommodate many of the United Kingdom qualification levels. In its current form the present active lesson plan is design to target learners at Levels 6 and 7 on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) and Credit and Qualifications Framework (CQFW) in England and Wales, Levels 10 and 11 on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) and Levels 6 and 7 on European Qualifications Framework (EQF).</p>
<p>The present active lesson plan does not expect nor require an individual to posses significant knowledge in Computing Science, Mathematics or Law.</p>
<h3 id="case">Case</h3>
<p>The basis of the activities in the present active lesson plan is the Commonwealth vs Michael Fiola case.</p>
<p>Michael Fiola was an investigator for the Department of Industrial Accidents in the United States and was required to complete significant field work. The Department of Industrial Accidents provided Fiola with a laptop, cellular access card and data plan to support his role. Months after receiving the laptop, a red flag was received to state that Fiola was consuming excessive data, some 4x more than others in a similar role. Consequently, Fiola’s laptop was brought in for review by the company, and illicit activity and material was identified and located on the system. Fiola’s employment was terminated and criminal charges were subsequently sought.</p>

<p>The session begins with a brief lecture on the significant concepts of information processing, in terms of triaging information as well as how to reduce and expand data where relevant within the context of digital investigations.</p>
<p>Learners will use this material as well as consideration of the case study to consider the major information processing steps in digital investigations.</p>
<h4 id="instructions">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Present their own information processing lecture or provide it in advance for students to consider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permit time for questions to address any misconceptions or issues with the material presented.</p>

<p>The lecturer or instructor at this point should provide a brief summary of the <em>Michael Fiola Vs Commonwealth</em> case to the class.</p>
<p>The motivation for providing the overview is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>address any misconceptions or gaps in understanding that students may have developed when considering the case in advance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support learners that have not considered the case in advance as to ensure they can effectively contribute to the activity.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Issue the activity sheet and advise pairs to consider the major steps in information processing of digital investigation in the context of the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise pairs to consider the incomplete cognitive model and start to think about what intervening actions an investigator would take to present a case from a selection of initial data sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pairs should then consider the different possible actions and distill them down to central steps in the information processing of a case from the perspective of a digital investigator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise pairs that they have to produce a presentation justifying the steps they devise. If the class is small enough then all pairs can present. However, in the situation where the class is large, suggest some at random will present. This will ensure pairs are aware that they <em>may</em> have to present and this will provide sufficient motivation to ensure they engage with the acitivty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wander between pairs and consider the major steps that groups are identifying so that they can be called upon later during a class-wide presentations.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Present the starting and ending point for most digital investigation in terms of information processing, i.e. external data sources and presentation of the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask class to offer the next step, the lecturer will then take answers and discuss them with the class. Asking for further possible steps before agreeing on a specific step. The lecturer should shape discussion and call on pairs, informed by the experience of wandering between the groups during the activity and what they observed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use an audience response system, such <a href="https://www.mentimeter.com">Mentimeter</a>, to consider each step and to ensure the majority of the class collectively agrees on the steps.</p>

<li>
<p>Permit time for questions to address any misconceptions or issues with the material presented.</p>

<h3 id="refining-task-model-with-analytical-loops">Refining task model with analytical loops</h3>
<p>Learners revisit the Cognitive Task Model devised from the previous activities. Pairs now consider the high-frequency iterative loops employed by investigators to strengthen their case.</p>
<h4 id="instructions-12">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Issue the incomplete class-wide task model with key steps and processes that has been generated from previous activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise learners to consider the material on analytical loops that investigators would employ to strengthen their case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask learners to consider the case and identify
a point where the investigator may have developed an initial theory but had no supporting data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask pairs when that is likely to occur within the information processing process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pairs should then annotate the Cognitive Task Model with the relevant analytical loop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pairs should then consider a the case and consider a point where the investigator encountered fragments of evidence but was unsure what connected them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pairs should then consider when that is likely to occur within the information processing process in the digital investigation and what actions did the investigator perform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pairs should then annotate the task model with the relevant analytical loop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collect the annotated Cognitive Task Model from pairs.</p>

<h3 id="class-collective-development-of-analytical-loops">Class collective development of Analytical Loops</h3>
<p>The aim is for the class to broadly devise the analytical processes that are pertinent to the previously defined class-wide Cognitive Task Model for information processing in digital investigations.</p>
<h4 id="instructions-13">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=random+number+generator">random number generator</a> to randomly select pairs to present. The lecturer may favour to select pairs on what they have observed, rather than randomly, to demonstrate and discuss with the entire class any novel insights or gaps in understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask for example where the investigator may have developed an initial theory but had no supporting data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask if any other pair has a different suggestion or approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecturer should then ask the pair that presented the example, what the investigator actually did or what the pair felt they likely did, if it not clear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss with class at what point such activity is likely to happen within the Cognitive Task Model and achieve consensus. Lecturer may consider using audience participation tools, such as <a href="https://www.mentimeter.com">Mentimeter</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lecturer should move on to consider the loop where an investigator may have data but is not clear how it relates or what it means. The lecturer can again use a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=random+number+generator">random number generator</a> to randomly select pairs to present or select a pair on what they have observed previously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask the class what they think the investigator would do in such a situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask if there are any other suggestions from others, before asking the presenting pair to state their
perception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss at what point such activity is likely to happen within the information processing process with the class and achieve consensus. Lecturer may consider using audience participation tools, such as Mentimeter.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-task-model-1">Cognitive Task Model</h2>
<p>The <strong>FOURTH</strong> block is used to conclude the active lesson plan and is focused on aligning the outcomes of the activities with material presented in the CyBOK.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/Forensics_v1.0.1.pdf">Cognitive Task Model from Pirolli &amp; Card</a> is presented to the class. The lecturer should highlight the key elements and afford the opportunity to ask questions.</p>
<h4 id="instructions-14">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Present the Cognitive Task Model and highlight the key steps, processes and loops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask the class if they have any questions or do not any aspect of what was covered in the session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask learners to complete the Quad Fold Activity.</p>
