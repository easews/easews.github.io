        <h1 id="forensic-process-active-lesson-plan">Forensic Process Active Lesson Plan</h1>
<p>The active lesson plan considers the significance of the <strong>forensics process</strong> and its importance in delivering evidence that is admissibility in a court of law. An <a href="../resources/process.m4v">overview video</a> outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The defining characteristic of forensic investigations is that their results must be admissible in court. This entails following established procedures for acquiring, storing, and processing of the evidence, employing scientifically established analytical tools and methods, and strict adherence to a professional code of practice and conduct.
<a href="https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/Forensics_v1.0.1.pdf">CyBOK Forensic Knowledge Area. Pg 12.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This active lesson plan scaffolds and supports learners in understanding the importance of following a process to reliably produce a valid case. Learners consider flawed digital investigations before appreciating the strengths and significance of a strong digital investigation procedure. The rationale for the approach is to motivate learners to appreciate strong digital investigation procedures.</p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>Learners complete <strong>FOUR</strong> blocks of activities that are designed to support them in understanding the importance of the digital investigation process. Learners are introduced to the significance of the forensic process through the following block of activities:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Scientific Process</strong>. The first block of activities supports learners in understanding the scientific process and how it underpins a strong forensic process. Learners will also consider what makes a strong forensic process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flawed Digital Investigations</strong>. Learners are expected to research and teach each other important aspects of the forensic process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Digital Investigation Stages</strong>. Learners will consider and apply the common stages of most digital investigation processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Forensics Process</strong>. An overview of the forensic process is presented to learners.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="qualification-level">Qualification Level</h3>
<p>The active lesson plan can be adjusted to accommodate many of the United Kingdom qualification levels. In its current form the active lesson plan is targeting learners at Levels 6 and 7 on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) and Credit and Qualifications Framework (CQFW) in England and Wales, Levels 10 and 11 on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) and Levels 6 and 7 on European Qualifications Framework (EQF).</p>
<p>The active lesson plan does not expect nor require an individual to posses significant knowledge in Computing Science, Mathematics or Law.</p>
<h3 id="case">Case</h3>
<p>The basis of the activities in the lesson plan is the Cuckoo's Egg.</p>
<p>Clifford Stoll, a research scientist, was working as a system administrator for the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and was tasked by management to resolve an accounting error of 75 cents associated with unpaid computing usage. Stoll used a scientific process and thorough investigation to determine the error was the result of an intrusion from a hacker, under the employ of the Soviet Union.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="scientific-process-of-digital-investigations">Scientific Process of Digital Investigations</h2>
<p>The <strong>FIRST</strong> block of activities supports learners in understanding the scientific process and how it underpins a strong forensic process. Learners will also consider what makes a strong forensic process.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Scientific Process</strong>. Instructor provides a brief lecture on the significant concepts of scientific process and relevance in digital investigations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Produce Summary of Cuckoo's Egg</strong>. Learners are required to produce a summary of the case being considered in the class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Overview of the Cuckoo's Egg</strong>. Instructor provides an overview of the case to the class to ensure every learner is starting from the same point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What makes a good forensics process?</strong> Learners consider and determine what the characteristics are of a strong forensic process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="scientific-process">Scientific Process</h3>
<p>The session begins with a brief lecture on the forensics process and the importance of reproducibility as well as validity of the tools, procedures and actions taken.</p>
<p>Learners will use this material as well as consideration of the case study to intimately consider the major steps in the forensic process.</p>
<h4 id="instructions">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Present their own forensic process lecturette or provide in advance for students to consider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permit time for questions to address any misconceptions or issues with the material presented.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="produce-summary-of-case-study">Produce Summary of Case Study</h3>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should advise learners to produce a summary of the case that will act as the foundation for activities.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>address any misconceptions or gaps in understanding that students may have developed when considering the case in advance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support those students that have no adequately considered the case in advance as to ensure they can effectively contribute to the activity.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Instruct learners to gather into groups of <strong>FOUR</strong> members and to assign each another a number between the range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask learners to consider the characteristics exhibited by strong and poor forensic processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State a number and state for the learner that is assigned that number they will be given a few minutes to consider the problem, write down the answer and pass it to their neighbour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process should continue until all group members have completed the task and no longer than 20 minutes total, representing a five minute block for each student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chair a discussion and ask learners to provide different characteristics of strong and weak forensic processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise learners that in the subsequent activities the class are going to consider <em>flawed digital investigations</em> and how the forensic process <em>did</em> or <em>did not</em> contribute to the failure of the investigation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="flawed-digital-investigations">Flawed Digital Investigations</h2>
<p>The <strong>SECOND</strong> block is designed to support learners in considering the processes used in flawed digital investigations and how such processes contribute to the failure of the investigation.</p>
<p>Learners are to form start-up firms and to participate in a Jigsaw Active Learning design to research and teach each other the different characteristics of the forensic process through consideration of flawed digital investigations.</p>
<h4 id="instructions-2">Instructions</h4>
<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Advise learners that they should self-organise into start-up firms of <strong>FIVE</strong> or <strong>FOUR</strong> members and if not, make themselves known to the lecturer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue the activity sheet and explain that teams are required to investigate and consider the cases provided and the characteristics of the forensic process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teams should consider the cases provided (or other cases the team have sourced) and the forensics process from specific perspectives - each member of the team acts as the <strong>EXPERT</strong> for that perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EXPERTS</strong> should spend time considering the aspect in more detail before meeting with the same experts from other teams, i.e. those considering the same perspective but for a different case potentially.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EXPERTS</strong> should discuss their perspective, share research and consolidate understanding before returning to their own teams and teaching them on the specific perspective they have considered.</p>

<p>The lecturer or instructor should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Issue the activity sheet to support and guide learners through the activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise learners to self-organise into pairs and that they are going to construct concept maps of the specific stages and steps in a standard digital investigation procedure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise pairs that they have up to <strong>FIVE</strong> minutes to assemble each concept map for a given stage. The lecturer will advise when <strong>ONE</strong> minute remains and when times elapses, the class will move onto the next stage. Until all stages are complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The class will then reset and the process will begin again, but this time pairs have to complete each stage as quickly as possible. Upon completion of all stages, the pair should signal so that the lecturer can confirm their entry and record their time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise class of the overall winners of the competition by considering the pairs that performed best across all the stages.</p>
