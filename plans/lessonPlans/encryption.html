        <h1 id="encryption-and-data-acquisition-active-lesson-plan">Encryption and Data Acquisition Active Lesson Plan</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This active lesson plan considers the data acquisition challenges for evidence in terms of encryption. The active lesson plan specifically considers the different <strong>legal</strong> and <strong>technical</strong> approaches to overcome encryption. An <a href="../resources/encryption.m4v">overview video</a> outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.</p>
<p>The <em>legal</em> approach as defined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The legal approach relies on compelling the person with knowledge of the relevant encryption keys to surrender them. This is relatively new legal territory and its treatment varies across jurisdictions. In the UK, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 specifies the circumstances under which individuals are legally required to disclose the keys. Disclosure may run counter the legal right against self-incrimination and in some jurisdictions, such as in the United States, it is not yet definitively resolved. <a href="https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/Forensics_v1.0.1.pdf">CyBOK Forensics Knowledge Area P(17)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>technical</em> approach as defined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The technical approach relies on finding algorithmic, implementation, or administrative errors, which allow the data protection to be subverted. Although it is nearly impossible to create a complex IT system that has no bugs, the discovery and exploitation of such deficiencies is becoming increasingly more difficult and resource intensive. <a href="https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/Forensics_v1.0.1.pdf">CyBOK Forensics Knowledge Area P(17)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>Learners complete <strong>FOUR</strong> blocks of activities that are designed to support them in appreciating the significant challenging in overcoming encryption. Using real-world cases staring points, instructors support learners through the following activity blocks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Overcoming Encryption.</strong> The first block of activities is designed to motivate learners to consider the different routes to overcome encryption for the purposes of digital investigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Legal Approaches to overcome Encryption.</strong> The second block of activities is designed to motivate learners to consider the different legal approaches to overcoming encryption used across the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical Approaches to overcome Encryption.</strong> The third block of activities is designed to motivate learners to consider the different technical approaches to overcoming encryption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acquisition.</strong> The fourth block is used to conclude the active lesson plan and is focused on aligning the outcomes of the activities with material presented in the CyBOK.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="qualification-level">Qualification Level</h3>
<p>The active lesson plan can be adjusted to accommodate many of the United Kingdom qualification levels. In its current form the active lesson plan is targeting learners at Levels 6 and 7 on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) and Credit and Qualifications Framework (CQFW) in England and Wales, Levels 10 and 11 on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) and Levels 6 and 7 on European Qualifications Framework (EQF).</p>
<p>The active lesson plan does not expect nor require an individual to posses significant knowledge in Computing Science, Mathematics or Law.</p>
<h3 id="case">Case</h3>
<p>The basis of the activities in the lesson plan is the In re Boucher case.</p>
<p>Sebastien Boucher crossed the border between Canada and the United States. Boucher was in possession of a laptop that was powered-on when he crossed the border. Inspection of the laptop suggested that Boucher was transporting child exploitation images. The laptop was powered down and Boucher was arrested. The laptop was subsequently powered-on but the contents were encrypted and material could not be decrypted. Unable to inspect the drive there was no way to locate and identify the child exploitation images on the laptop. Boucher was asked to provide the password that would grant access to key to decrypt the drive.</p>

<h2 id="overcoming-encryption">Overcoming Encryption</h2>
<p>The <strong>FIRST</strong> block of activities is designed to motivate learners to consider the different routes to overcome encryption for the purposes of digital investigation.</p>
<h3 id="block-structure">Block structure</h3>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Instruct learners to gather into groups of <strong>FOUR</strong> members and to assign each other a number between the range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learners are then set the task of considering the different approaches that can be used to overcome encryption for data at rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State a number and state that for the learner that is assigned that number they will be given a few minutes to consider the problem, write down the answer and pass it to their neighbour.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Chair a discussion and ask learners to provide different possible routes to overcoming encryption for the purposes of digital investigations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consolidate and advise learners that there are two broad routes, <em>legal</em> and <em>technical</em>, and these will now be considered in more depth over various activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Learners will teach each other about the legal approaches employed to compelled decryption using the <a href="https://www.jigsaw.org">Jigsaw Active Learning approach</a>.</p>
<p>Teams are to consider the legal approaches for a specific country. Each team member is to consider a specific aspect, consequently they are the <em>expert</em> for that particular aspect.
Experts from each team are to meet and discuss their aspect, before returning to their team and teaching them about the aspect. The team as a whole will then devise a presentation.</p>
<p>The team presentation will be given to the rest of the class to support a subsequent activity that afford learners in understanding the similar themes that all such legal approaches exhibit across the world.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Advise learners to self-organise into teams of <strong>FIVE</strong> or <strong>FOUR</strong> members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue the activity sheet and explain that teams are required to investigate in detail the legal approaches to compelled decryption for a specific county.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teams are to identify a country they want to investigate and confirm it with the lecturer. If they do not have an agreed country then one should be allocated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teams should consider the legal approaches from specific perspectives with each member of the team acting as an expert for that perspective and accepted to consider it in more detail and educate the rest of the team on that perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experts should spend time considering the aspect in more detail before meeting with the same experts from other teams, i.e. experts are those considering the same perspective but for a different country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experts should discuss their perspective, share research and consolidate understanding before returning to their own teams and teaching them on the specific perspective.</p>
