</li>
<li>
<p>Spend no more than <strong>10 minutes</strong> to expand consideration of grounds formulated in Step 2 by considering alternative explanations or positions that would undermine the expert evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generate a supporting summary of no more than <strong>100 words</strong> that confirms the adopted position and areas for further scrutiny.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Learners in considering the case should consider the following specific factors raised when considering expert evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
