<li><a href="resources/hartz.pdf">Bob Hartz Testimony</a>.</li>

<li>250-word summary (produced in advance by learners).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="task-0-preparation">Task 0: Preparation</h2>
<p>Learners should form pairs and exchange summaries of the case.</p>
<h2 id="task-1-consideration-reference-and-discussion-of-digital-evidence-by-court-members">Task 1: Consideration, reference and discussion of digital evidence by court members.</h2>
<p>The court ultimately decides the fate of Julie Amero, but it is important to understand the comprehension of members of the court in terms of the digital evidence being discussed and scrutinised.</p>
<p>The expectation is that learners should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Spend no more than <strong>20 minutes</strong> considering how expert evidence was <em>presented</em>, <em>scrutinised</em> and <em>discussed</em> by members of the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spend no more than <strong>10 minutes</strong> to formulate a position whether there could be grounds for appeal based on the actions of the members of court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spend no more than <strong>10 minutes</strong> to expand consideration of grounds formulated in Step 2 by alternative positions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generate a supporting summary of no more than <strong>100 words</strong> that confirms the adopted position and areas for further scrutiny.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Learners in considering the case should consider the following specific factors raised when considering expert evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Literacy.</strong> The literacy of the judge and attorney in reference to digital evidence and scrutiny of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Presentation of digital evidence.</strong> The presentation of digital evidence to the court. For example: presentation of the pornography images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scrutiny.</strong> The capacity of attorneys to effectively scrutinise the evidence presented in court.</p>
</li>
</ul>
