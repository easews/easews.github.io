<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Julie Amero was convicted for <strong>FOUR</strong> charges, including Risk of Injury to a Child that could have resulted in a 40-year sentence. Testimony from experts was admitted as evidence that contributed to the case against Julie Amero.</p>
<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="caseSummary.html">State of Connecticut v. Julie Amero case</a>.</li>
<li><a href="resources/hartz.pdf">Bob Hartz Testimony</a>.</li>
<li>250-word summary (produced in advance by learners).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="task-0-preparation">Task 0: Preparation</h2>
<p>Learners should form pairs and exchange summaries of the case.</p>
<h2 id="task-1-consideration-of-digital-evidence-to-under-malicious-internet-activity">Task 1: Consideration of digital evidence to under malicious Internet activity.</h2>
<p>An important aspect of the case was establishing alternative explanations for the malicious behaviour observed on the system and its source, specifically the significant number of unrelenting pornography &quot;pop-ups&quot;. The expectation is that learners should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Spend no more than <strong>20 minutes</strong> considering what expert evidence was used, if any, to establish alternative explanations for the malicious behaviour observed on the system and its source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spend no more than <strong>10 minutes</strong> to formulate a position whether there could be grounds for appeal based on this expert evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spend no more than <strong>10 minutes</strong> to expand consideration of grounds formulated in Step 2 by considering alternative explanations or positions that would undermine the expert evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generate a supporting summary of no more than <strong>100 words</strong> that confirms the adopted position and areas for further scrutiny.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Learners in considering the case should consider the following specific factors raised when considering expert evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mousetrapping.</strong> The discussion around the malicious activity of endless pop-ups of pornography material being displayed on the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spyware and malware.</strong> The consideration of spyware and malware being present on the system and testimony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quality of testimony.</strong> The expert testimony given and admitted into the court, if it was opinion, speculation or knowledge.</p>
</li>
</ul>
