<h2 id="task-0-form-into-firms">Task 0: Form into Firms</h2>
<p>Pairs should form start-up firms of no more than <strong>FOUR</strong> members and exchange summaries, summary positions adopted from consideration of prior expert testimony and behaviour of members of the court.</p>
<h2 id="task-1-devise-guidelines-for-handling-evidence">Task 1: Devise guidelines for handling evidence</h2>
<p>Start-up firms are expected to generate no more than <strong>FOUR</strong> guidelines to support authorities in admitting expert evidence into court.</p>
<p>The expectation is that start-up firms should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Spend no more than <strong>20 minutes</strong> considering and discussing the primary problems with expert evidence in the <em>State of Connecticut v. Julie Amero</em> case and the impact this had on Julie Amero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spend no more than <strong>20 minutes</strong> to formulate no more than <strong>FOUR</strong> guidelines that support members of the court, specifically the Judge, in admitting expert evidence into the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generate <strong>ONE</strong> presentation slide that succinctly outlines each of the guidelines as well as a brief rationale for each guideline. The presentation slide should take no more than <strong>TWO</strong> minutes for the firm to present.</p>
</li>
</ol>
