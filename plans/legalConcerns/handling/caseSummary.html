<p>Colin Francis Mowday was found guilty of being in possession of indecent images of children. The images were identified and located on three computer disks. The disks where collected from an Internet cafe next to a system that Mowday was using in March 2004. The owner of the Internet cafe had observed Mowday viewing indecent content on cafe systems. The owner contacted the police at which point they arrested the individual and confiscated the three disks. The three disks were investigated and images confirmed on January 2005. Mowday appealed the conviction, on several grounds, including that there was not sufficient evidence to state the indecent images where present on the disk at the point of seizure.</p>
