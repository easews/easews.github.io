<p>Include the birthday attack here?</p>
<p>The aim of the activity is for individuals to develop an understanding of the importance of <strong>handling evidence</strong> in terms of ensuring its admissibility in court.</p>
<p>The aim of the activity pack is for individuals to develop an awareness of the fundamental theory around different technical and legal approaches to forced and compelled decryption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Digital forensic techniques are also applied in a much broader range of inquiries, such as internal corporate investigations, that often do not result in formal proceedings in public court. Despite the fact that investigations may not require the same standard of proof, forensic analysts should always follow sound forensic practices in collecting and analysing the artifacts. This includes adherence to any judicial requirements when working with inherently personal data, which can be a non-trivial concern when the investigation is multi-jurisdictional. In such cases, it is important to seek timely legal advice to preserve the integrity of the inquiry.

<h3 id="task-overview">Task overview</h3>
<p>The class consider the case study in advance of Mowdry. Individuals are then asked to produce the main concerns of the problem in terms of what an individual might appeal on.
The second task is the class are presented some more of the scenario and then asked to pair up and come up with the main grounds of the appeal but also start to think about well what guidance could be provided to support digital investigations. The next step is the pairs come together and form groups. In the groups they come up with the four rules to support investigators for the acquisition and handling of evidence.</p>
<h3 id="task-1-summary-of-case-study">Task 1: Summary of case study</h3>
<p>Learners
The individual should produce a written up summary of the case and outline the main areas of concerns or questions.</p>
<h3 id="task-2">Task 2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The facts and grounds of appeal are contained in the reasons for judgment of Pullin JA. A central issue in the appeal is whether it was open on the evidence for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that pornographic images of children that were present on computer disks in January 2005 were on those same disks when they were seized from the appellant in March 2004, some 10 months earlier. The evidence established that:</p>
<ol>
<li>the appellant had physical custody and control of the disks whilst viewing pornographic images of children on a computer screen at an internet caf√© in Merredin;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>the disks seized from the appellant by police in March 2004 were the same disks which, when viewed by a police officer in January 2005, contained pornographic images;</li>
<li>after the disks were seized in March 2004 they were placed in locked storage in the Merredin police station and some time later transported by a police officer to Perth and handed to a police officer in the Computer Crime Section of the WA Police who signed for their receipt;</li>
<li>the Computer Crime Section returned the disks to Merredin police in December 2004.</li>
</ol>
<p>The case was brought to appeal. The first appeal grounds that was raised was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having regard to the evidence, the verdict of guilty is unreasonable or can not be supported by the evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Highlights aspects from the transcript that would justify this and then consider how guidance might be produced that would support investigators in the handling of evidence.</p>

<h3 id="task-3">Task 3</h3>
<p>The pairs should now form groups and consider the second ground for appeal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The evidence of the State taken at its highest was not capable of establishing beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="answers-for-lesson-plan">answers for lesson plan</h4>
<p>Notes for the instructor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specifics: The prosectors or the state are not able to actually establish that the police can confirm that the images they viewed on the disk in January 2005 were the same images on the disk in March 2004.</li>
<li>If we consider the ACPO guidelines: 1 applies, 3 applies and 4 applies. What does this mean? The argument cannot be made that data was introduced. A record of everything that was done should be recorded. 4 is probably the most important - they should have checked. Tricky one to consider.</li>
</ul>
