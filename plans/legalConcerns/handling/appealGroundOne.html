        <h1 id="first-appeal-ground-for-mowday-versus-the-state-of-western-australia-case">First Appeal Ground for Mowday versus The State of Western Australia case</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The original verdict reached in the <em>Mowday versus The State of Western Australia</em> case was disputed and appealed against by the defendant's council.</p>
<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="caseSummary.html">Mowday versus The State of Western Australia case</a>.</li>
<li><a href="resources/mowday.m4v">Transcript video</a></li>
<li><a href="resources/mowday.m4a">Transcript audio</a></li>
<li><a href="resources/mowday.pdf">Transcript PDF</a></li>
<li>250-word summary (produced in advance by learners).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="task-considering-whether-evidence-supported-the-verdict-reached">Task: Considering whether evidence supported the verdict reached.</h2>
<p>Learners should consider the <strong>FIRST APPEAL GROUND</strong> for the case in question. The first appeal ground is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ground I:
Having regard to the evidence, the verdict of guilty is unreasonable or can not be supported by the evidence.
<a href="https://jade.io/article/12808">MOWDAY -v- THE STATE OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expectation is that learners should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Spend no more than <strong>20 minutes</strong> considering the grounds of the appeal by considering the case and the 250-word summary produced in advance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spend no more than <strong>10 minutes</strong> to formulate a position whether the appeal should be granted and the rationale for the adopted position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generate a verdict with supporting summary of no more than <strong>100 words</strong> that confirms the adopted position and rationale.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Learners in considering the appeal should consider the following specific factors raised when considering their judgement:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Same images seized and viewed.</strong> 27 images of child exploitation were located and identified on systems in January 2005, but from disks seized in March 2004 from the appellant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuity of Evidence.</strong> Authorities seized a hard disk and disks but they were transported between different entities, including the Perth Computer Centre and Merredin Police as well as the Internet cafe.</p>
</li>
</ul>
