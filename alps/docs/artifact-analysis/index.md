# Artifact Analysis

* [Authenticating, Identifying and Triaging Data Active Lesson Plan](authenticating-identifying-and-triaging-data/). This active lesson plan considers artifact analysis from the perspective of applying hash functions to authenticate evidence and identify contraband as well as how hash functions can be used to filter and triage data as part of an investigation. An [overview video](resources/artifact.m4v) outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.
