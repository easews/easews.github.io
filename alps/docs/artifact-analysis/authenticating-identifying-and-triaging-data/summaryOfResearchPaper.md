# Summary of Fourth Amendment Search and the Power of the Hash

Salgado recognises that hash functions provide considerable value to forensics and the legal process.
Hash functions can be used to maintain the integrity of evidence.
Hash functions can be used to effectively triage data.
Hash functions can be used to identify contraband.
The last point is an area of concern because as hash value libraries grow, arguably so does infringement of privacy.
Hash functions have the potential to conduct privacy-preserving investigation of individuals as fingerprints produced by hash functions for give artifacts are considered, not the contents of the artifacts themselves.
Having said that, the debate is still around when such a process becomes an unauthorised search, that would violate the Fourth Amendment in the context of the United States.
Consequently, authorities and investigators need to balance privacy concerns with the technology used in law enforcement and forensics investigations.
