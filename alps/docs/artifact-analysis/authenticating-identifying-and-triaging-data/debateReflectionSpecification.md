## Debate Reflection Specification
Learners should spend time reflecting on the structured classroom debate, relate to prior activity and knowledge as well as produce notes of such connection. The following questions are designed to support you in reflecting on the debate.

Ask yourself:

* In your opinion, which team made the most compelling argument and why?

* Does the most compelling argument resonant with you? Do you agree with it?

* What is your position and did this position change when preparing for the in-class debate? Did the position change during the in-class debate itself?

* What did you learn, if anything from the debate?

* What material from the [CyBOK](https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/Forensics_v1.0.1.pdf) do you think is relevant to the debate?

* Do you think the debate would change your future practice or approach to a digital investigation?

### Feedback
Learners, should seek feedback on their reflective essay along the following dimensions:

* **Experiential connection**
  * Have you connected the answers to the questions to experiences in the debate itself?
  * Have you providing explanations as to why the arguments made are relevant to the material being discussed?


* **Depth**
  * Have you critical reflected on the debate and the material itself?
  * Did evidence or research inform positions presented by teams? Bias?
  * Have you considered what-ifs? Questioning positions that you agree with?


* **Breadth**
 * Have you considered alternative positions?
 * From what perspectives did you consider the arguments positioned? Academic, Civic or Personal?

### Plan for Action
Learners should use any feedback obtained to improve subsequent performance. Learners should use the [plan for action](/planForAction.html) sheet to act upon the feedback received.
