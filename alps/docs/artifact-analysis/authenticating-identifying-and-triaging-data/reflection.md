# Reflecting on the Limits of Fixed-space
Learners should spend time reflecting on the prior activities, relate the output of these activities to relevant knowledge and any notes generated. The following questions are designed to support you in reflecting on the debate.

Learners should ask themselves:

* Mapping arbitrary elements in the world to a fixed-space will result in collisions. How can this concern be overcome in the case of forensics?

* DNA testing will improve as will hash functions. However, specific hash functions could be undermined from the perspective of forensics in future. How can investigators guard against hash functions being undermined when a case is subsequent reviewed or revived by a future team?

* A slight alteration in an arbitrary element should result in a radical different output from a hash function. How problematic is this from the perspective of authentication in the context of forensics?
