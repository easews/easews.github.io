# Temple Island v New English Teas

Temple Island sued New English Teas in the United Kingdom over copyright infringement.
The infringement related to the use of images.
Specifically an image of a classic red routemaster London against a monochrome background of Westminster Bridge and Big Ben.
The judgement agreed or found for the claimant stating that although the two images in discussion were different the defendant work incorporated some of the claimants work.
The case is controversial and notable as it raises discussion around the limits of expression and composition in terms of intellectual property.
