## Task: Identify Emerging themes
Teams should spend **10** minutes discussing and recalling the presentations from other teams and begin to identify at least **THREE** emerging themes that were common across many or all of the presentations. Teams should also consider in whats way they diverge and novel or distinct insight other firms formed.

Teams should produce a **ONE** slide presentation that prioritises and describes **THREE** emerging themes as well as **ONE** novel divergence or insight that captured they observed from other teams.  

Teams should use the following concepts as starting points in the consideration of different emerging themes:

* **Fragmentation rates for file types.** How did firms recognise this when they generated mock file system containers? How do the carving algorithms devised by teams accommodate different fragmentation rates?

* **Adjacent file blocks.** How do the carving algorithms devised by teams decide how to determine the optimal sequence of file blocks?

* **Scale.** How do the carving algorithms devised by teams reflect the challenge that scale presents?
