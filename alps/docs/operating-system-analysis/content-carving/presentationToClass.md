## Task: Teams present solutions
Teams are required to present their algorithm and experience to class. The leader should introduce the presentation, members as well as the other firm that provided their problem file system.

The lecturer will advise when to commence and will signal when **ONE** minute is left. The class will clap the team off the stage when time has elapsed led by the lecturer.

Teams are not expected to take questions during the presentation, but may be called upon during any subsequent discussion.

#### Audience
Individuals when not presenting are expected to be present and listening to the presentation given by others. Presentation slides generated by others will be issued after the session completes but individuals should still make notes to support subsequent discussions, activities and reflection.
