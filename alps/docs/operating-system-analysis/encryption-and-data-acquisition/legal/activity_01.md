Each member of the team will act as resident expert for an aspect of the legal approach to key disclosure for a country or region. Each team member should select and research one of the following aspects:

* **Example of legal approach use to key disclosure for country or region.** An overview of the legal approach used in a case in terms of main points and novel aspects. Starting question: What aspect of key disclosure legislation was utilised by authorities in the investigation?

* **Motivation for legal approach in the country or region.** The stated or assumed motivation for adopting the legal approach by authorities in the country or region. Starting question: What was the motivation or rationale for adopting the legal approach to undermine encryption?

* **Impact of the legal approach in the country or region.**  The actual or envisioned impact of the key disclosure legislation in the country or region on and its consequence for future investigations. Starting question: What was the implications of the key disclosure legislation from on subsequent investigation procedures? For example, have additional steps been added or processes refined?

* **Ethical implications of the legal approach in the country or region.** The realised or potential ethical implications from the use of the resulting key disclosure legislation. Starting question: What was the ethical implications that could negatively impact wider society and culture?

Expert members have been provided with starting questions for each research area, but should not feel constrained by these questions.

### Task 2: Expert discussion on Specific Aspect of Legal Approaches to Key Disclosure for Country or Region
Each expert member should meet with the expert member from other start-ups and discuss the specific aspect they have researched.
 Each expert member should:

* **Share what they have discovered from their research.** Expert members should share the salient and interesting aspects of what they have learned from their research on legal approaches for the country or region.

* **Articulate expert presentation for start-up.** Expert members should share the presentation they are going to present to their team to get feedback and support from other expert members.

* **Support and provide feedback to other experts.** Expert members should provide feedback and support to other experts in shaping their presentation to their teams.

Experts should reflect on the feedback they received and what they have observed in their expert discussion session when refining their expert presentation.

Experts should recall that their teams are relying on their presentation of research into the specific aspect of legal approaches to undermine encryption.

### Task 3: Experts presentation to teams.
Experts should return to their teams and give their presentation. The leader of the firm should then determine the appropriate running order and ask each expert within the team to present their research.

The leader of the team should encourage team members to ask questions as well as ensure that presentations and questions for a particular aspect do not exceed **TEN** minutes.

### Task 4: Produce presentation for class
Teams are required to produce a **FIVE** by **FIVE** presentation, that is a presentation with **FIVE** slides that must not exceed **FIVE** minutes.

4. **Impact [1 minute].**  The actual or envisioned impact of the key disclosure legislation on the wider world and its consequence for future investigations.

5. **Ethical implications [1 minute].**  The realised or potential ethical implications from the use of the resulting key disclosure legislation.

Teams are permitted to include additional slides that they briefly consider, those slides are:

* *Title Slide* [10 - 20 seconds]. Team name, members and matriculation numbers.

* *Bibliography* [10 - 20 seconds]. References for supporting evidence, any established citation style permitted.
