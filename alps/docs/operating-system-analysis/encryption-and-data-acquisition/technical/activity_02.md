## Task: Categorising technical approaches
The class should consider the presentations and classify the different case studies and approaches observed using the following categories:

* **Algorithmic .** Encryption was undermined due to the design and nature of it. For example, limitations in key-size could result in the process being undermined via brute-force attack.

* **Administrative.** Encryption was undermined due to design and management decisions taken by an individual or provider. For example, the private element relied upon by the encryption approach was obtained by authorities.

* **Implementation.**  Encryption was undermined due to the implementation decisions taken by an individual or provider. For example, the encryption process was undermined as it was improperly implemented or deployed.

* **Miscellaneous .** Encryption was undermined in some other fashion that was not due to algorithmic, administrative or implementation errors.

Teams should carefully consider and discuss each case study when categorising them as may fall into two categories or may actually may be more accurately represented by one category than another.

For example, the private element relied upon by the encryption approach could be obtained because of poor understanding of implementation actions taken rather than explicit poor implementation decisions.
