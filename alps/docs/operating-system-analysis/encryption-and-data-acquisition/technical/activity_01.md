## Task: Firm to Research Case Study
The team member of the selected case becomes leader of the team and allocates artefacts as source material to team members.

Each team member then has **15 to 20 minutes** to consider their allocated artefact, summarises best they can within the constraints and produce a single slide.

The leader will watch over all other team members and assemble the slides into a coherent narrative and presentation for the class.
