# Forced Decryption through Technical Routes activity

The aim of the activity pack is for individuals to develop an awareness of the fundamental technical approaches to forced and compelled decryption.

> The technical approach relies on finding algorithmic, implementation, or administrative errors, which allow the data protection to be subverted. Although it is nearly impossible to create a complex IT system that has no bugs, the discovery and exploitation of such deficiencies is becoming increasingly more difficult and resource intensive.

## Aims, outcomes and opportunities

### Aims

The aim of the activity pack is for individuals to develop an awareness of the fundamental technical approaches to forced and compelled decryption.

### Intended Learning Outcomes

The expectation is that by the end of this activity, individuals will be able to:

1. identify, research and present information pertaining to technical approaches to undermine encryption. 

2. appraise the common themes and motivation for the application of technical approaches to undermine encryption.

### Skills development

The expectation is that this activity will afford the following skills development opportunities:

1. in collaboration skills as individuals work together to identify, research and present technical approaches to undermine encryption.

2. in analytical skills as individuals critically assess case studies and determine the emerging themes from consideration of multiple case studies.


## Activity
Learners are required to form start-up firms that are required to identify, research and present a case study on authorities in a specific context undermining encryption through application of a technical approach. Start-up firms are to research, produce and present a FIVE minute presentation. The class will then consider the themes and lessons learned from the various presentations. The resulting presentations as well as subsequent lessons learned will be made available to the class after the session.

### Materials
* Domain and Sector List.

### Form start-up
Individuals are required to form a start-up organisation of no more than **FIVE** members and no less than **FOUR** members. Firms should select a leader and select a domain or sector from the *Domain and Sector List* to research a case study that demonstrates a technical approach used to undermine encryption for the purposes of digital investigations.

A technical approach in this context can be broadly considered any approach that undermines encryption through exploitation of algorithmic, implementation, or administrative errors.

### Task 1: Identify and Confirm Case Study
Team members from each firm should identify a case study of a technical approach being used to undermine encryption for the purposes of digital investigations. Team members should produce a brief summary, no more than 250 words, that consider the following points:

* **Overview of case study.** An overview of the case study and the specific technical approach utilised.

* **Novel and/or interesting aspects for domain.** The novel and/or interesting aspects of the technical approach used in the domain.

* **Motivation for favouring case study.** The rationale and motivation for selecting the case study and why the firm should consider it as their primary case study to research and investigate.

Each team member must also identify **FIVE** artefacts that act as source material for the case study. The artefacts can be anything, from research articles, videos, audio recordings or a mixture of many media. Firms will rely upon the artefacts as source material if they select the case.

Team members should provide their firm with the summaries and each member should spend **10** minutes considering them and prioritising the case studies they favour, producing the top three case studies they want to consider excluding their own. Firms should gather and share their rankings before agreeing on the case study they want to consider in more depth.

### Task 2: Firm to Research Case Study
The team member of the selected case becomes leader of the group and allocates artefacts as source material to team members. Each team member then has **15 to 20 minutes** to consider their allocated artefact, summarises best they can within the constraints and produce a single slide. The leader will watch over all other team members and assemble the slides into a coherent narrative and presentation for the class.

### Task 3: Start-up firms to present to class
Start-up firms are required to present their research to class. The leader should introduce the presentation, team members as well as highlight the bibliography slide that points to supporting evidence. The leader should ensure the team keeps to time as instructed by lecturer.

The lecturer will advise when to commence and will signal when **ONE** minute is left. The class will clap the team off the stage at the five minute point as led by the lecturer.

Start-up firms should consider how to past between each member and how they will introduce themselves to peers. Teams are not expected to take questions during the presentation, but may be called upon during any subsequent discussion.

#### Audience
Start-up firms when not presenting are expected to be present and listening to the presentation given by other teams. Presentation slides generated by teams will be issued after the session complete but individuals should still make notes to support subsequent discussions.

### Task 4: Categorising technical approaches
The class should consider the presentations and classify the different case studies and approaches observed using the following categories:

* **Algorithmic .** Encryption was undermined due to design and nature of the encryption approached utilised. For example, limitations in key size could result in the process being undermined utilisation of brute-force approach.

* **Administrative.** Encryption was undermined due to design and management decisions taken by the individual or provider. For example, the private element relied upon by the encryption approach was obtained by authorities.

* **Implementation.** Encryption was undermined due to the implementation decisions taken by the individual or provider. For example, the encryption process was undermined as it was improperly implemented or deployed.

* **Miscellaneous .** Encryption was undermined in some other fashion that was not due to algorithmic, administrative or implementation errors.

Start-up firms should carefully consider and discuss each case study when categorising as case studies may fall into two categories or may actually may be more accurately represented by one than the other. For example, the private element relied upon by the encryption approach could be obtained because of poor understanding of implementation actions taken rather than explicit poor implementation decisions.

### Task 5: Identify Emerging themes
Start-up firms should spend **10** minutes discussing and recalling the case studies from other start-up firms and begin to identify at least **THREE** emerging themes that were common across many or all of the presentations. Start-up firms should produce a **ONE** slide presentation that prioritises and describes THREE emerging themes.  

Start-up firms will almost certainly identify their own themes, but some starting themes may include:

* **Oscillating popularity over time of favoured category approach.** The popularity of different technical approaches could varying over time, depending on various factors. For examples, exploiting algorithmic errors in encryption may have been favoured historically, before progressing on to favour exploitation of implementation errors.

* **Popularity of favoured category approach varies by context.** The popularity of different technical approaches could varying to different countries or domains. For example, exploiting administrative errors may be favoured for the financial sector.

* **Platform influences popularity of favoured category approach.** The favoured technical approach for undermining encryption could be influenced by a specific platform or service. For example, exploiting an implementation error in encryption may be favoured for messaging services.
