## Task: Identify and Confirm Case Study
Teams should identify a case study of a technical approach being used to undermine encryption for the purposes of digital investigations.

Team members should produce a brief summary, no more than 250 words, that considers the following points:

* **Overview of case study.** An overview of the case study and the specific technical approach utilised.

* **Novel and/or interesting aspects for domain.** The novel and/or interesting aspects of the technical approach used in the domain.

* **Motivation for favouring case study.** The rationale and motivation for selecting the case study and why the team should consider it as their primary case study to research and investigate.

Each team member must also identify **FIVE** artefacts that act as source material for the case study.

The artefacts can be anything, from research articles, videos, audio recordings or a mixture. Teams will rely upon the artefacts as source material if the case is selected.

Team members should provide their team with the summaries and each member should spend **TEN** minutes considering them and prioritising the case studies they favour, producing the top three case studies they want to consider (excluding their own).

Teams should gather and share their rankings before agreeing on the case study they want to consider in more depth.
