# Single System versus Distributed Systems Active Lesson Plan
This active lesson plan considers the challenges and opportunities that cloud computing represents to forensic investigations and investigators. Learners need are afforded the opportunity to appreciate the transition in forensics from considering single systems to distributed systems that comprises of many elements and connections.

The activity plan is designed to support learners in appreciating the fundamental characteristics of cloud computing, how these differ from the traditional model and how this presents opportunities and obstacle for forensics. An [overview video](cloud.m4v) outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.

> Cloud computing is fast emerging as the primary model for delivering information technology (IT) services to Internet-connected devices. It brings both disruptive challenges for current forensic tools, methods and processes, as well as qualitatively new forensic opportunities. [CyBOK Forensics Knowledge Area P(24)](https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/Forensics_v1.0.1.pdf)

## Structure
Learners complete **FOUR** blocks of activities that are designed to support them in appreciating the opportunities and obstacles for forensics in distributed systems. Using cloud computing as the basis, instructors support learning through the following activity blocks:

1. **Cloud Computing and Forensics.** The first block of activities is designed to support learners in cementing foundation in understanding the fundamentals of cloud computing and how these relate to forensics.

2. **Forensic Challenges in the Cloud.** The second block of activities is focused on supporting learners in developing an awareness of the opportunities and challenges that cloud computing represents to forensics.

3. **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Forensics.** The third block of activities affords learners the opportunity to gain insight into apply outcomes from prior activities to artifacts in the cloud.

4. **Cloud Application Forensics.** The fourth and final block is designed to conclude the active lesson plan and align material with that presented in the CyBOK.

### Qualification Level
The active lesson plan can be adjusted to accommodate many of the United Kingdom qualification levels. In its current form the active lesson plan is targeting learners at Levels 6 and 7 on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) and Credit and Qualifications Framework (CQFW) in England and Wales, Levels 10 and 11 on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) and Levels 6 and 7 on European Qualifications Framework (EQF).

The active lesson plan does not expect nor require an individual to posses significant knowledge in Computing Science, Mathematics or Law.

1. Issue learners with five index cards and advise them to number the index cards one to five.

2. Advise leaners they have **10** minutes to write five concepts or facts they know about cloud computing, one for every card. Advise learners they may phone or text a friend not in the class to help them complete the activity. Issue a **ONE** minute warning when time is about to elapse.

3. After time elapses ask learners to form pairs and determine if they have any matches. Advise learners to set aside cards that do not match.

4. After sufficient time has elapsed ask the pairs to join with another pair at tables to form a group of **FOUR** members. Ask pairs to determine, if any of their matched cards match any of the matched cards of the other pair.

5. After sufficient time has elapsed again ask the **TWO** groups of **FOUR** members to collapse into a group of **EIGHT** members. Advise the table to compare their matched cards of both comprising groups and tally their score.

6. Wander between groups collect their scores and check the index cards.

7. Advise the class of the leaderboard in terms of matched concept and reward the top three tables with a small reward to recognise achievement.

#### Materials
* Index cards (five for every learner).

* **Forensic Challenges in the Cloud.** The lecturer or instructor delivers a brief lecture on the primary challenges in conducting forensics in a distributed environment.

---

### Responsibilities in the Cloud
Learners will form pairs in this activity initially to consider the typical structure of a cloud computing environment before moving onto to consider the responsibilities of customers and clients for different service models.

The rationale is that this should support learners in appreciating the significant challenges of data ownership and service responsibility and how this impacts on forensics.

#### Instructions
The lecturer or instructor should:

1. Issue learners the [Responsibilities in the Cloud Activity Sheet](../cloud/responsibilitiesInTheCloudActivitySheet.html).

2. Recap material on cloud service providers, specifically in terms of the different terms of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).

3. Advise the learners they have been issued with the typical layers of the cloud computing environment. Advise them they have **FIVE** minutes to organise the layers from top to bottom.

4. After time has elapsed advise learners to form pairs and spend another **FIVE** minutes sharing and refining their arrangement of the layers. Advise learners to discuss any difference and attempt to form an agreed structure.

5. After time has elapsed, use an audience response system, such as [Mentimeter](http://www.mentimeter.com), and present three or more different arrangements of the layers. Ask the class to vote on the arrangement they think is most accurate.

6. Advise learners of the outcome and communicate the significance of each of the layers as well as emphasis the significance of data ownership and service responsibilities as indicated in the [CyBOK](https://www.cybok.org).

7. Advise learners they not have **15** minutes on their own to determine service responsibilities and data ownership for two actors, the customer and the cloud service provider, for each of the previously discussed service models. Learners should spend **FIVE** minutes on each service model.

8. After time has elapsed advise learners to form pairs and spend another **FIVE** minutes sharing and refining their perception of who is responsible in each of the service models.

9. After time elapses, use a [random number generator](https://www.google.com/search?q=random+number+generator) to select pairs to present.

10. Use a few pairs for each of the service models and ask the pairs to present their rationale and thinking.

11. For each of the service models, address any misconceptions and emphasise the correct solution.

12. Permit time for questions to address any misconceptions or issues with the material presented.

1. Advise learners that they are going to ask a question and all learners must be prepared to answer, but no learner is permitted answer unless called upon.

2. Advise learners that a video will be shown and questions will follow a theme of how what is observed is different or similar to extracting evidence from cloud computing.

3. Identify a video from the [Video Resources](../cloud/videoResourcesAndQuestions.html) and permit time for learners to watch the video either privately or collectively as a class. Optional: learners can watch the video in advance of the session.

4. The questions are designed to emphasis thinking around the challenges of forensics in the cloud as well as with the aim to relate the activity back to material in the [CyBOK](https://www.cybok.org).

5. Ask the first question related to logical acquisition and give sufficient time for the class to consider the question. It is also valuable to display the question to the class.

6. Select a learner at random and ask them to pick a number between 1 and the number of learners in the class. Consult the class register and call upon the learner that has the associated number. If the learner is not present, continue the process until a learner answers the question.

7. Continue the process so that several learners attempt the same question, unless it is not felt necessary.

8. After a sufficient number of learners have answered the question, move on to the next question.

9. Continue until all the questions have been tackled.

10. Advise learners that they should spend **FIVE** minutes reflecting on the activity and note any thoughts or misconceptions.
