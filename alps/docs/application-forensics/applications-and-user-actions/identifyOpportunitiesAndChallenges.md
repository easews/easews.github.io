# Task: Identify Opportunities and Challenges
Teams should spend at least **10** minutes discussing the Unicorn pitches from other teams and to identify at least **THREE** opportunities for using application data in the context of forensics.

Teams should also spend at least **10** minutes discussing the common criteria put forward by teams to identify at least **THREE** challenges for using application data in the context of forensics.   

Teams should produce a **ONE** slide presentation that covers **THREE** opportunities for application data in forensics and **THREE** obstacles or challenges in using application data.

Teams should use the following concepts as starting points in the consideration of different emerging themes:

* **User Action Evidence.** Why are applications a good resource for user engagement and insight? Are there any other sources of such data?

* **Analytical effort.** What is the analytical effort in using application data? Do investigators need to consider if the codebase is public or private? Do investigators need to concern themselves with specific protocols?

* **Scale.** Do investigators have concerns around the scale of the data generated by applications? Could it be a distraction from other elements of an investigation?
