# Cuckoo's Egg

Clifford Stoll, a research scientist, was working as a system administrator for the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and was tasked by management to resolve an accounting error of 75 cents associated with unpaid computing usage. Stoll used a scientific process and thorough investigation to determine the error was the result of an intrusion from a hacker, under the employ of the Soviet Union.
