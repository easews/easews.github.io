# Flawed investigations and the Forensics Process

## Overview
The aim of all digital investigations, whether they conclude in court or not, the results of the process must be admissible in a court of law. The process followed by investigators is crucial in ensuring admissibility of evidence. Consequently, in this activity learners are asked to consider flawed investigations.

### Materials
* [Flawed Digital Investigations Reading List](readingList)


### Form start-up
Individuals are required to form a start-up organisation of no more than **FIVE** members and no less than **FOUR** members.

### Task 1: Research characteristics of the Forensics Process
Each member of the start-up will act as resident expert for an aspect of the forensics process. Each team member should select and research one of the following aspects:

* **Data Provenance and Integrity.** Accepted standards and procedures must be followed by investigators when acquiring evidence.

* **Scientific Methodology.** The outcomes of an investigation should be reproducibility by a third-party to ensure validity.

* **Tool Validation.** The tools used within a digital investigation need to be validated.

* **Forensic Procedure.** The members of the court must have confidence in the outcomes of forensics process.

* **Triage.** The volume of data can result in investigations being delayed and salient points being missed. Consequently, effective triaging must be performed to reduce the data being considered.

### Task 2: Expert discussion on characteristics of the Forensics Process
Each expert member should meet with the expert member from other start-ups and discuss the specific aspect they have researched. Each expert member should:

* **Share what they have discovered from their research.** Expert members should share the salient and interesting aspects of what they have learned from their research on legal approaches for the country or region.

* **Articulate expert presentation for start-up.** Expert members should share the presentation they are going to present to their start-up to get feedback and support from other expert members.

* **Support and provide feedback to other experts.** Expert members should provide feedback and support to other experts in shaping their presentation to their start-up firms.

Experts should reflect on the feedback they received and what they have observed in their expert discussion session when refining their expert presentation. Experts should recall that their start-up firms are relying on their presentation of research into characteristics of the Forensics process.

### Task 3: Experts presentation to start-ups.

Experts should return to their start-up firm and give their presentation. The leader of the firm should then determine the appropriate running order and ask each expert within the start-up firm to present their research. The leader of the start-up firm should encourage members to ask questions as well as ensure that presentations and questions for a particular aspect do not exceed **10** minutes.
