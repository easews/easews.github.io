## Materials

* [Transcript video](resources/mowday.m4v)
* [Transcript audio](resources/mowday.m4a)
* [Transcript PDF](resources/mowday.pdf)

[MOWDAY -v- THE STATE OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA](https://jade.io/article/12808)

The expectation is that learners should:

1. Spend no more than **20 minutes** considering the grounds of the appeal by considering the case and the 250-word summary produced in advance.

2. Spend no more than **10 minutes** to formulate a position whether the appeal should be granted and the rationale for the adopted position.

3. Generate a verdict with supporting summary of no more than **100 words** that confirms the adopted position and rationale.

Learners in considering the appeal should consider the following specific factors raised when considering their judgement:

* **Same images seized and viewed.** 27 images of child exploitation were located and identified on systems in January 2005, but from disks seized in March 2004 from the appellant.

* **Continuity of Evidence.** Authorities seized a hard disk and disks but they were transported between different entities, including the Perth Computer Centre and Merredin Police as well as the Internet cafe.
