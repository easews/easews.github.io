# Expert Evidence and Handling Evidence Active Lesson Plan

The lesson plan considers the admissibility of evidence and the significant role the judge plays as gatekeeper. The activity plan supports individuals in developing understanding and awareness around **expert evidence** and the **handling of evidence**. A [overview video](../resources/admissibility.m4v) outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.

> Digital forensic techniques are also applied in a much broader range of inquiries, such as internal corporate investigations, that often do not result in formal proceedings in public court. Despite the fact that investigations may not require the same standard of proof, forensic analysts should always follow sound forensic practices in collecting and analysing the artifacts. This includes adherence to any judicial requirements when working with inherently personal data, which can be a non-trivial concern when the investigation is multi-jurisdictional. In such cases, it is important to seek timely legal advice to preserve the integrity of the inquiry.
[CyBOK Forensic Knowledge Area. Pg 5.](https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/Forensics_v1.0.1.pdf)

## Structure
Learners complete **FOUR** blocks of activities that are designed to support them in appreciating the significant challenging in admitting digital evidence into a court of law. Using real-world cases staring points, instructors support learners through the following activity blocks:

1. **Gatekeeper of the Court.** The first block of activities is designed to motivate learners to understand the challenges of *admitting evidence to court* and how the judge effectively acts as gatekeeper by ultimately deciding what is acceptable.

2. **Expert Evidence.** The second block of activities supports learners in considering the challenges in admitting expert testimony prior to the class devising guidelines for admitting expert testimony.

3. **Handling Evidence.** The third block of activities supports learners in considering the challenges of admitting digital evidence to court.

4. **Admissibility of Evidence.** The fourth block is used to conclude the active lesson plan and is focused on aligning the outcomes of the activities with material presented in the CyBOK.

### Qualification Level
The active lesson plan can be adjusted to accommodate many of the United Kingdom qualification levels. In its current form the active lesson plan is targeting learners at Levels 6 and 7 on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) and Credit and Qualifications Framework (CQFW) in England and Wales, Levels 10 and 11 on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) and Levels 6 and 7 on European Qualifications Framework (EQF).

The active lesson plan does not expect nor require an individual to posses significant knowledge in Computing Science, Mathematics or Law.

### Case
Two cases are used in this active lesson plan that act as the foundation for activities.

The first case is Julie Amero and is used as the foundation for understanding expert evidence. Julie Amero was a substitute teacher that was found guilty of several counts of risk of injury to a minor. Amero was accused of displaying pornographic and adult images to her class of minors. The images were displayed on a school computer system that Amero was using to conduct personal activities.

The second is Colin Mowday and is used as the foundation for understanding handling of digital evidence. Colin Francis Mowday was found guilty of being in possession of indecent images of children. The images were identified and located on three computer disks. The disks where collected from an Internet cafe next to a system that Mowday was using in March 2004. The owner of the Internet cafe had observed Mowday viewing indecent content on cafe systems. The owner contacted the police at which point they arrested the individual and confiscated the three disks. The three disks were investigated and images confirmed on January 2005. Mowday appealed the conviction, on several grounds, including that there was not sufficient evidence to state the indecent images where present on the disk at the point of seizure.

## Gatekeeper of the Court
The **FIRST** block of activities is designed to motivate learners to understand the challenges of *admitting evidence to court* and how the judge effectively acts as gatekeeper by ultimately deciding what is acceptable.

### Block structure
The block is structured as follows:

* **Admissibility**. Instructor provides a brief lecture on the significant concepts of admissibility of evidence.

* **Friend Flummox**. Learners are required to devise an exam question that will challenge a peer in the class on the topic of admissible evidence.

* **Themes from Friend Flummox Activity**. Instructor leads class discussion and activity on the themes that emerged from the exam questions.

* **Supporting the Gatekeeper**. Instructor provides brief lecture on the potential for guidelines to better support judges in admitting evidence.

---
### Admissibility
The session begins with a brief lecture on the significant concepts of admissibility of evidence, in terms of the challenges it represents to digital investigations.

Learners will use this material to appreciate the challenges around expert evidence and handling evidence.

#### Instructions
The lecturer or instructor should:

1. Present their own admissibility lecture or provide in advance for students to consider.

2. Permit time for questions to address any misconceptions or issues with the material presented.

---

### Friend Flummox
An engaging activity to motivate learners to engage with the admissibility of evidence material. Learners are required to devise an exam question that will challenge a peer in the class on the topic of admissible evidence.

The goal of the activity is to focus learners and to generate curiosity as well as to provide an opportunity for learners to develop interpersonal and communication skills.

#### Instructions
The lecturer or instructor should:

1. Advise class that they are required to create an exam question that probes understanding of admissible evidence but also challenges their peers. Learners can be as creative as they want in the design of the question, for example they do not need to restrict themselves to text.

2. Give the learners around **TEN** minutes to create the question.

3. Maintain and ensure energy in the room by walking through the class and advising when time is running out.

4. Instruct learners to form pairs or trios and exchange their exam questions. The pairs or trios then have **TEN** minutes to tackle the question. The questions do not need to be in exam conditions, learners can have fun and help each other out.

5. Collect all the exam questions from the learners.

#### Materials

* [Activity Sheet](../../general/friendFlummox)

### Themes from Friend Flummox Activity
The aim of the prior activity is to drive curiosity and interest in the challenge of admissible evidence. The lecturer should now focus the class by considering the themes that emerged in the exam questions and steer learners to areas of focus.

#### Instructions
The lecturer or instructor should:

1. Ask learners to nominate any particular good exam questions. Nominators should present the exam question to the class and state the advantages of the approach.

2. Open the question to the class and ask them to comment on the question and how they would approach it.

3. Repeat process until a number of questions have been considered. Open an audience response system activity, such as [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com), ask learners to submit some of the themes that emerge from these questions in terms of areas of focus.

4. Steer the consideration of themes along the significance of the *judge as gatekeeper* and how *digital investigators can support the judge in that role*.
