# Commonwealth vs Michael Fiola case

Michael Fiola was an investigator for the Department of Industrial Accidents in the United States and was required to complete significant field work. The Department of Industrial Accidents provided Fiola with a laptop, cellular access card and data plan to support his role. Months after receiving the laptop, a red flag was received to state that Fiola was consuming excessive data, some 4x more than others in a similar role. Consequently, Fiola’s laptop was brought in for review by the company, and illicit activity and material was identified and located on the system. Fiola’s employment was terminated and criminal charges where subsequently sought.
