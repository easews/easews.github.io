# Cognitive model for information processing in digital investigations

The aim of the activity is to support individuals in appreciating the cognitive steps as well as important processes and loops that are important to processing information as part of a digital investigation.

> On balance, only a tiny fraction of forensic analyses make it to the courtroom as formal evidence, although this should not constrain us from exploring the full spectrum of techniques for reconstructing the past of digital artifacts.

## Aims, outcomes and opportunities

### Aims

The aim of the activity is to support individuals in appreciating the cognitive steps as well as important processes and loops that are important to processing information as part of a digital investigation.

### Intended Learning Outcomes

The expectation is that by the end of this activity, individuals will be able to:

1. devise the significant cognitive steps involved in the processing of information in a digital investigation;

2. devise the abstraction and analytical processes involved in the processing of information in a digital investigation;

3. devise the cognitive loops in expanding, refining and appreciating information in a digital investigation.

### Skills development

The expectation is that this activity will afford the following skills development opportunities:

1. analytical and synthesis skills as individuals consider material to devise cognitive steps, processes and loops in the processing of information in a digital investigation;

2. communication and collaboration skills as individuals work together to come to solutions and present them to the wider class.

## Activity
The class will devise the cognitive steps, processes and loops in information processing for a digital investigation from consideration of a case study. Learners will form pairs, collaborate and communicate to the class the cognitive steps, processes and loops they have identified. The class will collectively form a cognitive model that encapsulates the cognitive steps, processes and loops, prior to considering an established model.

### Materials

* Sticky notes or index cards.
* Log File 1 (no trojan references).
* Log File 2 (trojan references).

### Task
Students should self-organise into pairs, that represent a digital investigation start-up. The pairs should name their start-up and advise the lecturer. The lecturer will then issue the start-up their first case, **Michael Fiola Vs Commonwealth**. Pairs are required to produce a cognitive model for information processing in digital investigations, that will support them and others in future investigations.

### Task 1: Key cognitive steps for the model.

Figure 1 illustrates an initial wireframe of the key steps for the cognitive model. Firms begin with **External Data Sources**, such as a hard disk, and then conclude with a **Presentation or Report** to the client that has employed their services.

|Figure 1: Key Cognitive Steps for processing information in digital investigations. |

Pairs should devise at least **FOUR** other key cognitive steps that investigators need to make to progress from External Data Sources to final Presentation or Report.

1. **Actions [5 minutes].** Pairs should consider all the possible actions and elements that an investigations may take in progressing from external data sources to the final presentation. For each action or step, pairs should note it down on the sticky notes or index cards provided. Firms should note down as many as possible.
2. **Consolidate [5 minutes].** Pairs should consolidate and start to group actions and elements together to form more concrete and abstract steps as many as they think necessary. For example, many actions could form together in identifying specific evidence or organising evidence into some narrative.
3. **Refine [5 minutes].** Pairs should continue to refine the steps until they have no more than **SIX** cognitive steps, including the initial step of **External Data Sources** and the closing step of **Presentation or Report**.
4. **Document [5 minutes].** Pairs should produce a **FIVE** minute presentation, one minute articulating and providing justification for each of the steps as well as one minute for introductions.

### Task 2: Abstraction processes

Figure 2 illustrates further development of the cognitive model. Pairs should now consider the abstraction or bottom-up processes that support investigators in progressing from External Data Sources to Presentation or Report. Pairs have been given the initial abstraction process of **Search and Filter**, where investigators may use keyword analysis and timestamps to only consider data pertinent to the investigation and discard the rest. Pairs have also been given the final abstraction process of **Tell Story**, where the investigator present their findings or narrative based on evidence to the court or panel.

The client wants to determine if the employee is performing any criminal activity. Pairs should determine what, if any, criminal activity is from the log file as well as devise at least **THREE** other key abstraction processes that investigators perform to progress from External Data Sources to the final Presentation or Report.

1. **Consider first log file [10 minutes].** One of the partners should consider the first log file from the case. The log file contains salient data points gleaned from a hard disk from the case study. The partner considering the log file and start to formulate a narrative of the suspected criminal behaviour of the former employee, the member should also *think aloud* of the actions and steps they are taking.
2. **Support, encourage and identify [10 minutes].** The other partner should act as coach and monitor the partner considering the log. The coach should support and encourage the other partner, for example: praising when they make a useful insight and correcting if they have made a mistake. The other partner should also identify the abstraction processes that the other partner is performing in considering the data and progressing towards their narrative. The partner should note down the potential abstraction processes on the sticky notes or index cards provided.
3. **Consolidate abstraction process [5 minutes].** The pair should now consolidate the potential abstraction processes into no more than **THREE** that fit within the current model.
4. **Document [5 minutes].** Pairs should produce a **THREE** minute presentation, one minute articulating and providing justification for each of the abstraction processes.

### Task 3: Analytical Processes

Figure 3 illustrates further development of the cognitive model. Pairs should now consider the analytical or top-down processes that support investigators in progressing Presentation or Report back to the from External Data Sources. Pairs have been given the initial analytical process of **Re-evaluate**, where investigators upon receiving additional information from client may to reconsider their hypothesis or consider alternative theories. Pairs have also been given the last analytical process of **Search for Information**, where investigators may seek additional information from the data or reconsider the data already collected.

The client has advised that the former employee complete rejects the accused criminal behaviour. Pairs should determine an alternative theory or explanation from consideration of the second log file as well as devise at least **THREE** other key analytical processes that investigators perform in progress from Presentation or Report down to External Data Sources.

1. **Consider second log file [10 minutes].** The partner that acted as coach in the previous task, should now consider the second log file in this task. The partner considering the second log file should formulate an alternative theory that may explain the data points, the member should also *think aloud* of the actions and steps they are taking.
2. **Support, encourage and identify [10 minutes].** The other partner should act as coach this time and monitor the partner considering the second log file. The coach should support and encourage the other partner, for example: praising when they make a useful insight and correcting if they have made a mistake. The other partner should also identify the analytical processes that the other partner is performing in considering the data. The partner should note down the potential analytical processes on the sticky notes or index cards provided.
3. **Consolidate abstraction process [5 minutes].** The pair should now consolidate the potential analytical processes into no more than **THREE** that fit within the current model.
4. **Document [5 minutes].** Pairs should produce a **THREE** minute presentation, one minute articulating and providing justification for each of the analytical processes.
