# Sequencing Events and Information Processing Active Lesson Plan
This active lesson plan considers the **steps**, **processes** and **loops** an investigator performs when processing information as part of a digital investigation. An [overview video](../resources/sequence.m4v) outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.

## Overview
The [CyBOK presents the Cognitive Task Model from Pirolli & Card](https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/Forensics_v1.0.1.pdf) as an approach to understand how digital investigators process information from external data sources to final presentation of evidence.

This active lesson plan scaffolds and supports learners in devising their own cognitive task model before comparing and contrasting it with the model presented in the CyBOK. The rationale for this approach is for learners to actively engage with the cognitive process that investigators perform when   extracting and analysing evidence, rather than just learning about it from the CyBOK.

### Structure
Learners complete **FOUR** blocks of activities that are designed to support them in devising their own cognitive task model. Using a real-world case as a staring point, instructors support learning through the following activity blocks:

1. **Cognitive Steps in Information Processing.** The first block of activities supports learners in devising and understanding the fundamental steps to process information from external data sources to the final presentation of evidence.

2. **Processes.** The second block of activities supports learners in devising and understanding the abstraction and analytical processes that are used to progress between the major information processing steps (devised in the prior block of activities).

3. **Loops.** The third block of activities supports learners in appreciating the analytical information processing loops required to refine and improve evidence.

4. **Cognitive Task Model.** The fourth and final block of activities closes the lesson plan and learners consider the Cognitive Task Model from the CyBOK. Learners compare and contrast the model devised through activities in the lesson plan with that presented in the CyBOK.

### Qualification Level
The active lesson plan can be adjusted to accommodate many of the United Kingdom qualification levels. In its current form the active lesson plan is targeting learners at Levels 6 and 7 on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) and Credit and Qualifications Framework (CQFW) in England and Wales, Levels 10 and 11 on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) and Levels 6 and 7 on European Qualifications Framework (EQF).

The active lesson plan does not expect nor require an individual to posses significant knowledge in Computing Science, Mathematics or Law.

### Case
The basis of the activities in the lesson plan is the Commonwealth vs Michael Fiola case.

Michael Fiola was an investigator for the Department of Industrial Accidents in the United States and was required to complete significant field work. The Department of Industrial Accidents provided Fiola with a laptop, cellular access card and data plan to support his role. Months after receiving the laptop, a red flag was received to state that Fiola consuming excessive data, some 4x more than others in a similar role. Consequently, Fiola’s laptop was brought in for review by the company, and illicit activity and material was identified and located on the system. Fiola’s employment was terminated and criminal charges where subsequently sought.

### Overview of Information Processing
The session begins with a brief lecture on the significant concepts of information processing, in terms of triaging information as well as how to reduce and expand data where relevant within the context of digital investigations.

Learners will use this material as well as consideration of the case study to intimately consider the major information processing steps in digital investigations.

#### Instructions
The lecturer or instructor should:

1. Present their own information processing lecture or provide it in advance for students to consider.

2. Permit time for questions to address any misconceptions or issues with the material presented.

---

### Produce Summary of Case Study
The lecturer or instructor should advise learners to produce a summary of the case that will act as the foundation for activities.

Optional: the lecturer or instructor can set this as an *entry ticket activity* as in they are required to complete in advance of session.

#### Materials
* [Activity Sheet](cognitive-steps-in-information-processing/produceSummary)

---

### Overview of Michael Fiola Vs Commonwealth case
The lecturer or instructor at this point should provide a brief summary of the *Michael Fiola Vs Commonwealth* case to the class.

The motivation for providing the overview is:

* address any misconceptions or gaps in understanding that students may have developed when considering the case in advance.

* support those students that have no adequately considered the case in advance as to ensure they can effectively contribute to the activity.

#### Materials
* [Case Summary](cognitive-steps-in-information-processing/caseSummary)

### Devising the Cognitive Steps for Information Processing in Digital Investigations
Learners are expected to form pairs and identify the major steps in information processing within an investigation, starting with external data sources and progressing to presentation of the case.

#### Instructions
The lecturer or instructor should:

1. Issue the activity sheet and advise pairs to consider the major steps in information processing of digital investigation in the context of the case.

2. Advise pairs to consider the incomplete cognitive model and start to think about what intervening actions an investigator would take to present a case from a selection of initial data sources.

3. Pairs should then consider the different possible actions and distill them down to central steps in the information processing of a case from the perspective of a digital investigator.

3. Advise pairs that they have to produce a presentation justifying the steps they devise. If the class is small enough then all pairs can present. However, in the situation where the class is large, suggest some at random will present. This will ensure pairs are aware that they *may* have to present will ensure they are sufficiently motivated to complete the activity.

4. Wander between pairs and consider the major steps that groups are identifying so that they can be called upon later during a class-wide presentations.

6. Collect presentations and task models from students.

#### Materials
* [Activity Sheet](cognitive-steps-in-information-processing/)
* [Incomplete Cognitive Model](resources/incompleteCognitiveModel)

### Class collective development of Cognitive Steps
The aim is for learners to collectively agree the key steps in the task of information processing within the digital investigation.

#### Instructions
The lecturer or instructor should:

1. Use a [random number generator](https://www.google.com/search?q=random+number+generator) to randomly select pairs to present. The lecturer may favour to select pairs on what they have observed, rather than randomly, to demonstrate and discuss with the entire class any novel insights or gaps in understanding.

2. Present the starting and ending point for most digital investigation in terms of information processing, i.e. external data sources and presentation of the case.

3. Ask class to offer the next step, the lecturer will then take answers and discuss them with the class. Asking for further possible steps before agreeing on a specific step. The lecturer should shape discussion and call on pairs, informed by the experience of wandering between the groups during the activity and what they observed.

4. Use an audience response system, such [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com), to consider each step and to ensure the majority of the class collectively agrees on the steps.

5. Conclude the session with a complete, class generated task model from all the case studies considered.

5. Begin with consideration of the initial step in the Cognitive Task Model, notionally the consideration of external data sources.

6. Reposition the Cognitive Task Model as a staircase and then ask the class for appropriate processes that would fit to progress up the staircase.

7. Shape discussion as likely to receive many different suggestions. Having said that, the lecturer will want to note the others in front of the class as to use them later. For example, by recording them on a whiteboard.

8. Continue in the approach until the most significant abstraction processes are detailed. It is not a concern if all are not documented or some are incomplete as a debriefing session follows the activity.
