# Friend Flummox
Learners are going to devise an exam question that challenges peers but also probes understanding of challenges around the admissibility of evidence.

## Task 1: Devise the exam question
Learners should start by reflecting on the interesting challenges surrounding the admissibility of evidence. Then consider how you can creatively assess if a peer is aware of such challenges.

Learners then should consider how they would ask the question, it could be text or require demonstration of a skill. Learners are not constrained to text alone.

## Task 2: Self-organise into Groups of Pairs
Learners are to self-organise into pairs or groups and exchange their exam questions or communicate how they are going to examine peers.

Partner-up and start to work your way through the different exam questions that have been formulated in the group. Have fun and help each other out with answering the questions.

After completing each question, reflect and document what you felt was strong about the exam question as well as how it could be improved.

## Task 3: Nominate exam question
Reflecting on the exam question posed by peer, if you feel the question devised by a peer is creative and/or challenging then nominate it. The lecturer or instructor will then get the class to vote on the strongest submission.

The lecturer or instructor will ask you to:

1. **Explain the exam question.** Outline the premise of the exam question.

2. **Communicate why it is creative.** Explain to the class why the question itself is creative and novel.

3. **Explain what it probes.** Rationale as to what the exam question probes.

4. **Explain why that is important for the course.** Rationale as to why the question is important for the course itself.
