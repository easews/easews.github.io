# Scenario: Card Wash
The present scenario consider the common example of fraudsters infiltrating point of sale ("POS") systems and installing malware to exfiltrating valuable personal information such as credit and debit card details that can be used to commit fraud. The present scenario is based on a real-world example and supports learners in considering the value of considering live system analysis.

### Background
* Many organisations rely on "point of sale" (POS) terminals to interface with customer credit and debit cards for payments of goods and services.
* POS terminals come in many different forms and names, but can include system that involve systems such as traditional personal computers or specialised tablets.
* Corporations around the world are becoming increasingly concerned about the "point of sale" (POS) terminals they employ becoming compromised by fraudsters that use malicious software or malware to exfiltrate personal data, such as credit and debit card data outside the organisation.
* Fraudsters can then use this information to commit crimes against customers.

### Scenario
* Authorities recently arrested an individual for possessing stolen credit and debit card details for eight different individuals.
* The individual possessed credit and debit cards for each of the individuals, but these were not stolen but were gift cards that had been tampered with to mimic credit and debit cards.
* The Authorities discovered the individual in question via complaint from one of the individuals that had their debit card information stolen.
* The complaint stated that someone had committed fraud by making purchases at a local store.
* Authorities contacted the store and retrieved footage of the individual in question. The cashier stated the individual regularly purchased items from the store, specifically gift cards.
* In purchasing the gift cards, the individual would use several cards until one of the cards covered payment.
* Authorities investigated further and in-cooperation with financial institutions were able to determine that all the victims had paid for services at the same car wash.
* Authorities plan to seize the systems from the car wash and investigate staff to determine if they are stealing card information.
* Authorities are unsure whether to investigate live systems and/or capture volatile memory due to the risk of compromising the systems in general with little benefit gained from investigating the live system or volatile memory.
