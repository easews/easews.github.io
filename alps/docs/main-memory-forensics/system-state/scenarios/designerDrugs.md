# Scenario: Designer Drugs
The present scenario considers the challenge of designer drugs and how individuals can use social networking services as central systems to advertise and distribute such rapidly evolving products. The present scenario is based on a real-world example and supports learners in considering the value of considering live system analysis.

### Background
* Governments around the world have becoming increasingly concerned about the prevalence and impact of new psychoactive substances (NPS).
* There is existing knowledge and legislation around many natural and synthetic drugs and chemicals.
* However, there is an increasing trend towards designing drugs that subvert existing legal, technical and operational instruments.
* Designer drugs can be altered to deliver the same impact as existing drugs but are not detectable via existing tests.
* Similarly, designer drugs can be labelled, marketed and sold to avoid legal scrutiny. For example:
  - in the United Kingdom designer drugs can be referred to as plant food to avoid classification under the Medicines Act
  - whereas in the United States they may be referred to as bath salts to avoid classification under the Federal Analog Act (FAA).

### Scenario
* The Drug Enforcement officers for a given city have identified advertising of designer drugs for a given region.
* The force have identified advertisements on city streets, both in the form of graffiti and illegal fly posting, contains information to do with Skype and Facebook page.
* The Facebook page presents images of the synthetic drugs as well as details.
* The information identified enabled the force to identify and arrest the individual selling the designer drugs.
* The force was able to seize the individual's computer systems.
* The police force has determined that images on Facebook do not contain EXIF data that would enable them to link back to the system or individual.
* The police also have no information to suggest the individual posted the information to the social network or has ever accessed it.
* The police are concerned that the individual may have security settings, practiced hygiene such as clearing the cache and browser as well as minimise storage of information.
