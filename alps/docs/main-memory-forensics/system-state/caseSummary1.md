# Gordon v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

Todd Gordon, Marc Mercer, Kristen Mercer, Kristin Baker, Michelle Fowler, Greg Lawson and Judy Conrad brought a class action against Chipotle Mexican Grill.
The action regards a data breach where plaintiffs used their credit or debit cards at Chipotle locations to pay for goods and services.
The action claims that in doing so this exposed plaintiffs personal information and subsequent fraud.
The plaintiffs claim Chipotle made inadequate provision to protect their information and their payment implementation choices resulted in point of service ("POS") that involved systems that were subject to malware that fraudsters can use to compromise organisations and steal information.
