# In re Boucher

Sebastien Boucher crossed the border between Canada and the United States. Boucher was in possession of a laptop that was powered-on when he crossed the border. Inspection of the laptop suggested that Boucher was transporting child exploitation images. The laptop was powered down and Boucher was arrested. The laptop was subsequently powered-on but the contents were encrypted and material could not be decrypted. Unable to inspect the drive there was no way to locate and identify the child exploitation images on the laptop. Boucher was asked to provide the password that would grant access to key to decrypt the drive.
