# Network Connections Activity Sheet
Learners are to complete the following:

1. Consult the [TCP Connections](../memory/TCPConnections.html) information sheet and consider the **CONSOLE OUPUT** from [Volatility Framework](https://www.volatilityfoundation.org) after execution of the ```connscann``` plugin on the captured memory image.

2. There is more than one connection listed, the next interesting aspect is to consider those network connections that remained open at the point of memory image capture.

3. Consult the [Open Sockets](../memory/openSockets.html) information sheet and consider the **CONSOLE OUPUT** from [Volatility Framework](https://www.volatilityfoundation.org) after execution of the ```sockets``` plugin on the captured memory image.

4. Remain in pairs from prior activity. Pairs have **15** minutes to identify interesting information that emerges from consideration the [TCP Connections](../memory/TCPConnections.html) output and [Open Sockets](../memory/openSockets.html) output related to the outcome of the previous block of activities on processes. The instructor will issue a **ONE** minute warning when time is nearly elapsed.
