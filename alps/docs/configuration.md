# Expert Evidence and Handling Evidence Active Lesson Plan

The lesson plan considers the admissibility of evidence and the significant role the judge plays as gatekeeper. The activity plan supports individuals in developing understanding and awareness around **expert evidence** and the **handling of evidence**. A [overview video](../resources/admissibility.m4v) outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.

> Digital forensic techniques are also applied in a much broader range of inquiries, such as internal corporate investigations, that often do not result in formal proceedings in public court. Despite the fact that investigations may not require the same standard of proof, forensic analysts should always follow sound forensic practices in collecting and analysing the artifacts. This includes adherence to any judicial requirements when working with inherently personal data, which can be a non-trivial concern when the investigation is multi-jurisdictional. In such cases, it is important to seek timely legal advice to preserve the integrity of the inquiry.
[CyBOK Forensic Knowledge Area. Pg 5.](https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/Forensics_v1.0.1.pdf)

## Structure
Learners complete **FOUR** blocks of activities that are designed to support them in appreciating the significant challenging in admitting digital evidence into a court of law. Using real-world cases staring points, instructors support learners through the following activity blocks:

1. **Gatekeeper of the Court.** The first block of activities is designed to motivate learners to understand the challenges of *admitting evidence to court* and how the judge effectively acts as gatekeeper by ultimately deciding what is acceptable.

2. **Expert Evidence.** The second block of activities supports learners in considering the challenges in admitting expert testimony prior to the class devising guidelines for admitting expert testimony.

3. **Handling Evidence.** The third block of activities supports learners in considering the challenges of admitting digital evidence to court.

4. **Admissibility of Evidence.** The fourth block is used to conclude the active lesson plan and is focused on aligning the outcomes of the activities with material presented in the CyBOK.

### Qualification Level
The active lesson plan can be adjusted to accommodate many of the United Kingdom qualification levels. In its current form the active lesson plan is targeting learners at Levels 6 and 7 on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) and Credit and Qualifications Framework (CQFW) in England and Wales, Levels 10 and 11 on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) and Levels 6 and 7 on European Qualifications Framework (EQF).

The active lesson plan does not expect nor require an individual to posses significant knowledge in Computing Science, Mathematics or Law.

### Case
Two cases are used in this active lesson plan that act as the foundation for activities.

The first case is Julie Amero and is used as the foundation for understanding expert evidence. Julie Amero was a substitute teacher that was found guilty of several counts of risk of injury to a minor. Amero was accused of displaying pornographic and adult images to her class of minors. The images were displayed on a school computer system that Amero was using to conduct personal activities.

The second is Colin Mowday and is used as the foundation for understanding handling of digital evidence. Colin Francis Mowday was found guilty of being in possession of indecent images of children. The images were identified and located on three computer disks. The disks where collected from an Internet cafe next to a system that Mowday was using in March 2004. The owner of the Internet cafe had observed Mowday viewing indecent content on cafe systems. The owner contacted the police at which point they arrested the individual and confiscated the three disks. The three disks were investigated and images confirmed on January 2005. Mowday appealed the conviction, on several grounds, including that there was not sufficient evidence to state the indecent images where present on the disk at the point of seizure.

#### Instructions
The lecturer or instructor should:

1. Present their own admissibility lecture or provide in advance for students to consider.

2. Permit time for questions to address any misconceptions or issues with the material presented.

---

### Friend Flummox
An engaging activity to motivate learners to engage with the admissibility of evidence material. Learners are required to devise an exam question that will challenge a peer in the class on the topic of admissible evidence.

The goal of the activity is to focus learners and to generate curiosity as well as to provide an opportunity for learners to develop interpersonal and communication skills.

#### Instructions
The lecturer or instructor should:

1. Advise class that they are required to create an exam question that probes understanding of admissible evidence but also challenges their peers. Learners can be as creative as they want in the design of the question, for example they do not need to restrict themselves to text.

2. Give the learners around **TEN** minutes to create the question.

3. Maintain and ensure energy in the room by walking through the class and advising when time is running out.

4. Instruct learners to form pairs or trios and exchange their exam questions. The pairs or trios then have **TEN** minutes to tackle the question. The questions do not need to be in exam conditions, learners can have fun and help each other out.

5. Collect all the exam questions from the learners.

#### Materials

## Mermaid Diagrams
{: .d-inline-block }

New (v0.4.0)
{: .label .label-green }

The minimum configuration requires the key for `version` ([from jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/)) in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
mermaid:
  # Version of mermaid library
  # Pick an available version from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/
  version: "9.1.3"
```

Provide a `path` instead of a `version` key to load the mermaid library from a local file.

See [the Code documentation]({% link docs/ui-components/code.md %}#mermaid-diagram-code-blocks) for more configuration options and information.

## Aux links

```yaml
# Aux links for the upper right navigation
aux_links:
  "Just the Docs on GitHub":
    - "//github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs"

# Makes Aux links open in a new tab. Default is false
aux_links_new_tab: false
```

## Heading anchor links

```yaml
# Heading anchor links appear on hover over h1-h6 tags in page content
# allowing users to deep link to a particular heading on a page.
#
# Supports true (default) or false
heading_anchors: true
```

## External navigation links
{: .d-inline-block }

New (v0.4.0)
{: .label .label-green }

External links can be added to the navigation through the `nav_external_links` option.
See [Navigation Structure]({% link docs/navigation-structure.md %}#external-navigation-links) for more details.

## Footer content

```yaml
# Footer content
# appears at the bottom of every page's main content
# Note: The footer_content option is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Please use `_includes/footer_custom.html` for more robust
markup / liquid-based content.
footer_content: "Copyright &copy; 2017-2020 Patrick Marsceill. Distributed by an <a href=\"https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs/tree/main/LICENSE.txt\">MIT license.</a>"

# Footer last edited timestamp
last_edit_timestamp: true # show or hide edit time - page must have `last_modified_date` defined in the frontmatter
last_edit_time_format: "%b %e %Y at %I:%M %p" # uses ruby's time format: https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/time/rdoc/Time.html

# Footer "Edit this page on GitHub" link text
gh_edit_link: true # show or hide edit this page link
gh_edit_link_text: "Edit this page on GitHub."
gh_edit_repository: "https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs" # the github URL for your repo
gh_edit_branch: "main" # the branch that your docs is served from
# gh_edit_source: docs # the source that your files originate from
gh_edit_view_mode: "tree" # "tree" or "edit" if you want the user to jump into the editor immediately
```

_note: `footer_content` is deprecated, but still supported. For a better experience we have moved this into an include called `_includes/footer_custom.html` which will allow for robust markup / liquid-based content._

- the "page last modified" data will only display if a page has a key called `last_modified_date`, formatted in some readable date format
- `last_edit_time_format` uses Ruby's DateTime formatter; see examples and more information [at this link.](https://apidock.com/ruby/DateTime/strftime)
- `gh_edit_repository` is the URL of the project's GitHub repository
- `gh_edit_branch` is the branch that the docs site is served from; defaults to `main`
- `gh_edit_source` is the source directory that your project files are stored in (should be the same as [site.source](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/))
- `gh_edit_view_mode` is `"tree"` by default, which brings the user to the github page; switch to `"edit"` to bring the user directly into editing mode

## Color scheme

```yaml
# Color scheme supports "light" (default) and "dark"
color_scheme: dark
```

<button class="btn js-toggle-dark-mode">Preview dark color scheme</button>

<script>
const toggleDarkMode = document.querySelector('.js-toggle-dark-mode');

jtd.addEvent(toggleDarkMode, 'click', function(){
  if (jtd.getTheme() === 'dark') {
    jtd.setTheme('light');
    toggleDarkMode.textContent = 'Preview dark color scheme';
  } else {
    jtd.setTheme('dark');
    toggleDarkMode.textContent = 'Return to the light side';
  }
});
</script>

See [Customization]({% link docs/customization.md %}) for more information.

## Callouts
{: .d-inline-block }

New (v0.4.0)
{: .label .label-green }

To use this feature, you need to configure a `color` and (optionally) `title` for each kind of callout you want to use, e.g.:

```yaml
callouts:
  warning:
    title: Warning
    color: red
```

This uses the color `$red-000` for the background of the callout, and `$red-300` for the title and box decoration.[^dark] You can then style a paragraph as a `warning` callout like this:

```markdown
{: .warning }
A paragraph...
```

[^dark]:
    If you use the `dark` color scheme, this callout uses `$red-300` for the background, and `$red-000` for the title.

The colors `grey-lt`, `grey-dk`, `purple`, `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, and `red` are predefined; to use a custom color, you need to define its `000` and `300` levels in your SCSS files. For example, to use `pink`, add the following to your `_sass/custom/setup.scss` file:

```scss
$pink-000: #f77ef1;
$pink-100: #f967f1;
$pink-200: #e94ee1;
$pink-300: #dd2cd4;
```

You can override the default `opacity` of the background for a particular callout, e.g.:

```yaml
callouts:
  custom:
    color: pink
    opacity: 0.3
```

You can change the default opacity (`0.2`) for all callouts, e.g.:

```yaml
callouts_opacity: 0.3
```

You can also adjust the overall level of callouts.
The value of `callouts_level` is either `quiet` or `loud`;
`loud` increases the saturation and lightness of the backgrounds.
The default level is `quiet` when using the `light` or custom color schemes,
and `loud` when using the `dark color scheme.`

See [Callouts]({% link docs/ui-components/callouts.md %}) for more information.

## Google Analytics

{: .warning }
> [Google Analytics 4 will replace Universal Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528). On **July 1, 2023**, standard Universal Analytics properties will stop processing new hits. The earlier you migrate, the more historical data and insights you will have in Google Analytics 4.

Universal Analytics (UA) and Google Analytics 4 (GA4) properties are supported.

```yaml
# Google Analytics Tracking (optional)
# Supports a CSV of tracking ID strings (eg. "UA-1234567-89,G-1AB234CDE5")
ga_tracking: UA-2709176-10
ga_tracking_anonymize_ip: true # Use GDPR compliant Google Analytics settings (true/nil by default)
```

### Multiple IDs
{: .d-inline-block .no_toc }

New (v0.4.0)
{: .label .label-green }

This theme supports multiple comma-separated tracking IDs. This helps seamlessly transition UA properties to GA4 properties by tracking both for a while.

```yaml
ga_tracking: "UA-1234567-89,G-1AB234CDE5"
```

## Document collections

By default, the navigation and search include normal [pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/).
You can also use [Jekyll collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) which group documents semantically together.

{: .warning }
> Collection folders always start with an underscore (`_`), e.g. `_tests`. You won't see your collections if you omit the prefix.

For example, put all your test files in the `_tests` folder and create the `tests` collection:

```yaml
# Define Jekyll collections
collections:
  # Define a collection named "tests", its documents reside in the "_tests" directory
  tests:
    permalink: "/:collection/:path/"
    output: true

just_the_docs:
  # Define which collections are used in just-the-docs
  collections:
    # Reference the "tests" collection
    tests:
      # Give the collection a name
      name: Tests
      # Exclude the collection from the navigation
      # Supports true or false (default)
      # nav_exclude: true
      # Fold the collection in the navigation
      # Supports true or false (default)
      # nav_fold: true  # note: this option is new in v0.4
      # Exclude the collection from the search
      # Supports true or false (default)
      # search_exclude: true
```

The navigation for all your normal pages (if any) is displayed before those in collections.

You can reference multiple collections.
This creates categories in the navigation with the configured names.

```yaml
collections:
  tests:
    permalink: "/:collection/:path/"
    output: true
  tutorials:
    permalink: "/:collection/:path/"
    output: true

just_the_docs:
  collections:
    tests:
      name: Tests
    tutorials:
      name: Tutorials
```

When *all* your pages are in a single collection, its name is not displayed.

The navigation for each collection is a separate name space for page titles: a page in one collection cannot be a child of a page in a different collection, or of a normal page.
