## Lesson Plans

There **NINE** active lesson plans across the **SIX** subsection of the CyBOK Forensics Knowledge Area.

### 1. Definitions and Conceptual Models

 * [Sequencing Events and Information Processing Active Lesson Plan](docs/definitions-and-conceptual-models/sequencing-events-and-information-processing/). This active lesson plan considers the **steps**, **processes** and **loops** an investigator performs when processing information as part of a digital investigation. An [overview video](resources/sequence.m4v) outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.

 * [Expert Evidence and Handling Evidence Active Lesson Plan](docs/definitions-and-conceptual-models/expert-evidence-and-handling-evidence/). This active lesson plan considers the admissibility of evidence and the significant role the judge plays as gatekeeper. The plan supports individuals in developing an understanding and awareness around **expert evidence** and the **handling of evidence**. A [overview video](resources/admissibility.m4v) outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.

 * [Forensic Process Active Lesson Plan](docs/definitions-and-conceptual-models/forensic-process/). This active lesson plan considers the significance of the **forensics process** and its importance in delivering evidence that is admissible in a court of law. An [overview video](resources/process.m4v) outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.

### 2. Operating System Analysis

 * [Encryption and Data Acquisition Active Lesson Plan](docs/operating-system-analysis/encryption-and-data-acquisition/). This active lesson plan considers the data acquisition challenges for evidence in terms of encryption. The active lesson plan specifically considers the different **legal** and **technical** approaches to overcome encryption. An [overview video](resources/encryption.m4v) outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.

 * [Content Carving Active Lesson Plan](docs/operating-system-analysis/content-carving/). This active lesson plan considers data acquisition challenges in terms of content carving. The plan is designed to support individuals in developing an initial awareness of the fundamental theory and concepts surrounding **file and content carving**. An [overview video](resources/carving.m4v) outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.

### 3. Main Memory Forensics

* [System State Active Lesson Plan](docs/main-memory-forensics/system-state/). This active lesson plan considers analysis of system state using volatile main memory. The active lesson plan is designed to support individuals in developing an initial awareness of how analysis of main memory can support a forensics investigation. An [overview video](resources/memory.m4v) outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.

### 4. Application Forensics

* [Applications and User Actions Lesson Plan](docs/application-forensics/applications-and-user-actions/). The lesson plan highlights the potential of applications to provide valuable and powerful evidence within the legal process of user engagement and intention. An [overview video](resources/application.m4v) outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.

### 5. Cloud Forensics

* [Single System versus Distributed Systems Active Lesson Plan](docs/cloud-forensics/single-system-versus-distributed-systems/). This active lesson plan considers the challenges and opportunities that cloud computing represents to forensic investigations and investigators. An [overview video](resources/cloud.m4v) outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.

### 6. Artifact Analysis

* [Authenticating, Identifying and Triaging Data Active Lesson Plan](docs/artifact-analysis/authenticating-identifying-and-triaging-data/). This active lesson plan considers artifact analysis from the perspective of applying hash functions to authenticate evidence and identify contraband as well as how hash functions can be used to filter and triage data as part of an investigation. An [overview video](resources/artifact.m4v) outlines the structure of the active lesson plan.
